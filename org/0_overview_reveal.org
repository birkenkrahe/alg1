** *Instructor Introduction*
- Background and experience
- Course objectives and expectations
#+begin_notes
- I've not taught data structures or algorithms before.
- It's been a bit of a struggle because it's complex.
- There's not one textbook so I had to read 12 or more.
- Lots of decisions to be made along the way like C/C++.
- Can be taught entirely theoretically (not very fun).
- My approach is exactly as in CSC 100: learning by doing.

#+begin_notes
"Big-O" refers to a way of measuring the efficiency of an algorithm by
estimating how many operations it will take to complete. Some courses
start out with discussing this but I might park it until CSC 265.
#+end_notes
** *Course Requirements*

- Use Google chat to share your stuff, too
#+begin_notes
I don't mind if you contact me at impossible hours via Google chat
because I often work at impossible hours. Don't be cross if you don't
get an answer right away. Tell me which course you're referring to and
attach enough information so that I don't have to keep asking too many
questions, and/or just talk to me during office hours or after class.

game. More details later.
#+end_notes
* Questions with Answers
Some questions that I ask myself, and that I needed answers for.
#+begin_notes
When I wrote this, I had several questions that I needed to answer
myself - here they are - the long answers are in the PDF. Please ask
your own questions now!
#+end_notes
** What if you don't know (or remember C or C++?
- Any introductory programming class is OK
- Complete the entry quiz (Aug 19, 11:50pm)
- Check out: freeCodeCamp (video, 3 hrs.), and The Rook's Guide to C++
  (book, 100 pg.)
#+begin_notes
You should have taken introductory programming in Java or Python or
C/C++: Both Java and Python are high-level languages, but C/C++ is
quite different (and quite a bit more complicated, too).

Make sure you take the (optional ) entry quiz and complete the
(optional) entry programming assignment if you didn't do it yet. If
you meet the August 19, 11:50 pm deadline, you get some bonus
points, too.

If you have any weaknesses in the basics (or if you haven't studied
C/C++ yet at all), read "The Rook's Guide to C++" for free and answer
the review questions. Sample solutions available online in GitHub.

Otherwise we'll be reviewing (and adding to) our knowledge of C/C++ in
the first few weeks of the course. If you had Java, you already know a
lot about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
#+end_notes
** Will I be able to work on this course from home?

- You can use your personal virtual Linux box from anywhere using =ssh=
  and graphics
- You can install Linux via dual boot / VirtualBox or (on Windows)
  with WSL
- Use GitHub as a central repo and clone to your local machine(s) as I
  do it.

#+begin_notes
Absolutely. You'll be using a personal virtual Linux box on our
dedicated Lyon computer and data science server, and you can login
to this system from anywhere as long as you've got an Internet
connection.

If that doesn't work for you for whatever reason (connection,
convenience etc.) then you can easily install Linux via dual boot,
as a virtual machine on your PC, or on Windows with the WSL
system. On MacOS, you have a form of Unix already, so you're set.

In this case, you can put your GitHub skills to good use: create a
repository for this course where you keep the latest version of all
your files, and clone it to your local PC. This is what I do, too:
I'm working on my files in different locations, and I use Git to
maintain the latest version on any machine at any time.
#+end_notes
** Why did you choose C/C++ for "data structures"?

- C/C++ is compiled & much, much faster than Python or R
- C/C++ offers memory allocation and deallocation control
- C/C++ have large Standard (Template) Libraries available
- C/C++ used in industry for performance-critical applications (games,
  space, robotics)

#+begin_notes
I did not choose it, the catalog (and wiser, older professors
before me) did. But I'm on board with it for a number of reasons:
- C/C++ is *compiled* (unlike Python) and offers high performance,
  which you need for big data and *complex* algorithms (like machine
  learning).
- C/C++ offers explicit *control* over memory allocation and
  deallocation, which is essential to know how data structures work
  under the hood.
- C++ in particular has a Standard Template Library (STL) which
  offers template classes for *common* data structures (vectors,
  lists, queues, stacks) and algorithms, which saves time and helps
  you learn.
- C/C++ is used in industry for performance-*critical* applications
  (like large-scale multi-player network games, network
  communication, or space exploration and communications).
#+end_notes
** But most programs are in C not in C++ - why is that?

- Object-orientation adds (unnecessary) layers of abstraction
- The programming language should not get in the way of problem
  solving
- Once you understand it in C, you can take your knowledge anywhere
- See also: Bad Boy Mower story, August 2024

#+begin_notes
After working out many lectures in C++ only, I realized that
Object-orientation and the extra layers of abstraction that C++
brings, are actually in the way of understanding the essence of
data structures.

This essence is not "what can this language do?" but "how can you
store, organize, and access data to solve a given problem most
efficiently." This question is largely language-independent, and so
we want that the language does not get in the way to our solving
problems algorithmically.

The arguments given by Zingaro in favor of C in his 2024 book
"Algorithmic Thinking" resonated with me, too. Once you understand
this stuff in C, you can take your knowledge anywhere, to any other
language, wherever problems can be solved computationally.

Another data point: tell Wyatt's story (2014 metal sheet cutter) - A
couple of days ago, a former student of mine showed me around the
factory where he develops new high performance lawn mowers (that's big
business in the US, believe it or not). He showed me a table where he
cuts metal sheets so that he can build new things. The machine was
from 2014, and the computer and the software for it were insulated
from the Internet and any other network because the firmware had not
been updated since 2014 - he said that was quite common for many other
large machines that they have. So any update has to be developed by
them and transferred to the machine manually with a thumb drive - and
often they don't do it or badly because it's so hard to understand (&
maintain & improve) the original programs that came with the
machine. This struck me as another nice application for literate
programming.

#+end_notes
** What are my favorite programming languages?
- Lisp (Emacs - 1980s)
- C/C++ (computational physics - 1990s)
- SQL (databases - 2000s)
- R (data analytics - 2010s)
- Python (machine learning - 2020s)

#+begin_notes
Though I have (passing) knowledge of many programming languages,
C/C++, Python, SQL and Lisp are becoming my main go-to languages
for performance (C++), data science (Python), database applications
(SQL), and Emacs customization (Lisp).

R is great for visualization and stats, and was another one of my
favorite languages but it is slowly falling out of my quality world
because of the dominance of the "Tidyverse" ([[https://github.com/matloff/TidyverseSkeptic][see here]]). The data
science intro courses are however still in R (with some Python).

I learnt these languages at different times in my life: Lisp
because of Emacs (late 1980s), C++ in the 1990s, SQL in 2005, R in
2019, and Python in 2022. C++ has developed massively since then
though and I am more comfortable with its subset C than with many
of the modern developments of the language - but I'm keen to learn!

How well do I know them? I think: Lisp (5%), C/C++ (30%), SQL (50%), R
(50%), Python (25%) - but these estimates may be way off, too!
#+end_notes
** Why did you not choose Python given that it's the most popular programming language?
- Python consumes 76 x more energy than C
- Python is 72 x slower than C
- Python abstracts memory and performance management away
#+begin_notes
Python has some serious deficiencies compared to C/C++, most
importantly speed. Here is an interesting paper that shows that
Python consumes 76 times more energy and is 72 times slower than C.
#+attr_html: :width 400px:
[[../img/python_vs_C.png]]

But more importantly for the purpose of learning about data
structures: Python abstracts away many details such as memory
management, which are crucial to understanding why to choose one data
structure over another. C gives you much more control over system
resources - which is critical for some of the most popular
applications like AI and Large Language Models. The only real reason
to pick Python is that it's easier to learn and use. But that's also a
reason to pick C because so many more people are fluent in Python than
in C.

Here is ChatGPT's estimate: C (1.5-2 mio), C++ (4-5 mio), C# (6-7
mio), Python (10-12 mio). So with C you're 5-6 times more valuable but
in the end it's also much more difficult to become a master at C.

But at the end of the day, it's a personal decision. In my case,
I'm also better at C than Python, and I like the control it gives.
#+end_notes
** What's the difference between C, C++ and C#?
#+attr_html: :width 900px:
[[../img/c_vs_cpp_vs_c_hash.png]]

#+begin_notes
The list shows the simplicity of C vs. C++ vs. C#, and the
independence on complicated paradigms and commercial solutions -
which translates into deeper understanding and freedom from fads.

Here is a [[https://youtu.be/sNMtjs_wQiE?si=yI86h-gvonkJ5gDG][short video]] that summarizes C vs. C++ vs. C# (conaticus,
2022). And here is [[https://youtu.be/juKv1aHEikI?si=lrEIoJb11ABAz38h][another one]] by a YouTuber who specializes in
coding interview preparation, and who prefers C because it is
devoid of external dependencies - essentially useful on its own
(NeedCode, 2024).
#+end_notes

** Can this course help me break into Game Programming?

- Data structures and algorithms enhance computing performance
- Speed is critical for (multiplayer) games
- C/C# are more directly relevant

#+begin_notes
Only in so far as data structures and algorithms are performance
enhancing choices, which are critical when programming games. Other
than that, C++ and C# are more directly relevant for game
development.
#+end_notes

** Can this course help me break into Cybersecurity?

- Emacs = the ultimate hacker editor
- Linux = the dominant server OS
- C = the system programming language

#+begin_notes
Absolutely: the mixture of Emacs + Linux + C is the winning
solution for cybersecurity.
#+end_notes
** Can this course help me break into Artificial Intelligence?
- C memory management and speed crucial for large scale AI
- Algorithms rely heavily on data structures (matrix ops)
- C is important for embedded and edge AI (IoT)
#+begin_notes
- *Memory Management*: C allows precise control over memory, which is crucial for optimizing the performance of AI algorithms, especially when dealing with large datasets or real-time processing. Data structures like arrays, linked lists, and trees can be implemented with minimal overhead.
- *Speed*: C is known for its execution speed, which is essential in AI applications where processing speed is critical, such as in deep learning or real-time decision-making systems.
- *Algorithm Implementation*: Many AI algorithms, including those for searching, sorting, and graph traversal, rely heavily on data structures. Understanding how these are implemented in C can help optimize these algorithms for specific hardware or applications.
- *Low-Level Operations*: For tasks like matrix operations, which are fundamental in machine learning, understanding and implementing these operations efficiently at a low level can lead to performance improvements.
- *Resource-Constrained Environments*: C is often used in embedded systems where AI models need to run on devices with limited computational resources. Efficient data structures are crucial in such environments to ensure that AI applications can function correctly within the constraints.
- *Specialized AI Models*: When developing specialized AI solutions, especially those requiring custom data handling (e.g., specialized neural networks or reinforcement learning systems), having a deep understanding of data structures in C can be advantageous. It allows for the creation of custom, optimized data structures tailored to the specific needs of the AI application.
- *Integration with High-Level Languages*: Many AI applications are developed in higher-level languages like Python. However, performance-critical components are often written in C (or C++) and then interfaced with these higher-level languages. Understanding C data structures is essential for writing these components.
#+end_notes

* Course content

This is a vast topic. If you're anything like me, you like a clear
roadmap with code examples. So here's all of what we'll cover in the
briefest form possible, including definitions + fake code.

** Data Types

Data types classify the type of data a variable can hold, and the
operations that can be performed on it.

*Which data types do you know?*

** Primitive Data Types

- =int=: Integer type
- =float= / =double=: Floating-point types
- =char=: Character type
- =void=: Special purpose type
- =size_t=: size of objects in bytes
  
** What do you know about these data types?

#+attr_html: :width 400px:
[[../img/question.png]]

** What you should know about primitive data types

| Data type | Format    | Byte size |    MAX |
|-----------+-----------+-----------+--------|
| =int=       | =%d= =%ld=    |         4 | 2^32-1 |
| =float=     | =%f= =%g= =%e=  |         4 | 10^38  |
| =double=    | =%lf= =%g= =%e= |         8 | 10^308 |
| =char=      | =%c=        |         1 |    127 |

* Development tools

This section is shared across my courses. Apologies if you have to
hear/do it twice but remember: imitation, repetition, and memorization
will help you master this stuff!

** Pep talk for developers

- Computer & data science = "maker spaces"
- 15 minutes per day beats 1 hour per week
- Professionals rely on excellent tool kits
- Your tools include: Linux, Emacs, GitHub, GNU C Compiler (=gcc=), GNU
  Debugger (=gdb=)

#+begin_notes
- Computer and data science courses are "maker spaces": you're
  supposed to make stuff rather than only listen and be passive. Your
  "making" is "developing software", and flex your programming
  muscles. It's like weight training or running: 15 minutes per day
  beats 1 hour once a week.

- In computer and data science, your professional development is only
  as good as your toolkit. Your toolkit for this course includes:
  1) The Linux operating system and the shell
  2) The Emacs editor with the Org-mode package
  3) The GitHub software engineering platform
#+end_notes

** Linux - the world's premier Operating System

- Linux server for exclusive use by CS and DS
- If you completed CSC 420 you're well prepared (if not, CSC 420 will
  be easy!)
- You get your own Ubuntu LTS 22.04 system
- Access from anywhere with Internet (=ssh=)
- Daily use = massive edge in job market

#+begin_notes
- A summer research grant 2024, and the gracious professional support
  of Lyon's IT Services enabled us to establish a Linux server for
  exclusive use in computer and data science courses.

- If you completed my Operating Systems course or if you were exposed
  to Linux in some other way (e.g. via WSL, the Windows Subsystem for
  Linux), you know more than enough Linux to feel comfortable.

- For the duration of the term, you get your own virtual Linux PC
  running Ubuntu LTS 22.04. This is where we will do all our
  work. Emacs, R, Python, C++, SQLite are pre-installed on your PC.

- You can access this PC from anywhere with an Internet connection.

- You can use this PC in all your classes - no need to look back to

[[../img/lindisfarne.jpg]]

/Evangelist Mark, Lindisfarne Gospels, 715 AD/.
*** -----
- Written in C and Lisp (first AI language) in the 1970s
- Self-extensible Macro editor, free, open source software
- Fully customizable and almost an operating system
- Rich documentation and vibrant expert user community
- Direct access to Unix and C manual pages
- Packages: Dired, Magit, Tramp, Helm, Info, Eshell

#+begin_notes
*Emacs* is a self-extensible, free, open source editor written in a
Lisp dialect, and first published in the 1980s by Richard
Stallman. It is a hacker- and power-user tool because of its
customizability and openess. The vanilla version can be
downloaded from [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs][gnu.org/software/emacs]]. Famous applications:
[[https://orgmode.org][Org-mode]] (for literate programming) and [[https://magit.vc/][magit]] (for
Git). Additional resource: [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/refcard.pdf][Emacs Reference Card]].

- Dired is the built-in directory editor in Emacs for file management
- Magit is an interface to Git, the version control system behind
  GitHub so that you can interact with your repositories in Emacs
- Tramp (Transparent Remote Access, Multiple Protocols) allows you to
  edit files on remote machines as if they were local.
- Helm: auto-completion tool (I use Ivy + Swiper instead)
- Info: built-in documentation tool
- Eshell: built-in Linux shell simulator

Why this image? When asking about a medieval painting that resembles
the essence of Emacs, ChatGPT suggested the illuminations of the
Lindisfarne Gospels and the Book of Kells.

*** What can Org-mode do for you?
#+attr_html: :width 300px:
[[../img/orgmode1.png]]
#+begin_notes
*Org-mode* is an Emacs mode (plugin or extension package) for
plain-text note-taking, task management, documentation. It was
first released in 2003 by Carsten Dominik. More information at
[[https://orgmode.org/][orgmode.org]]. Famous application: [[http://literateprogramming.com/][literate programming]],

*** What is Literate Programming?
#+attr_html: :width 600px:
[[../img/knuth.jpg]]
#+begin_notes
*Literate Programming* is a programming paradigm introduced by
Donald Knuth in the 1970. It emphasises writing code and
documentation together to make programs better structured and
more enjoyable to read and understand by humans. More information
at [[http://literateprogramming.com/][literateprogramming.com]].  Famous application: The [[https://www.ctan.org/starter][TeX]]
typesetting system, which dominates technical and scientific
publishing.

*** How can you run the "Hello World" program in C++ inside Emacs?

*** -----
#+begin_example C++
#+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output
  cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
#+end_src
#+end_example
This is what you're saving:
#+begin_src C++ :results output :exports both
  // include input/output library
  #include <iostream>
  // use standard namespace for cout, endl
  using namespace std;
  int main() { // begin of main function
    // stream string to standard output then print newline
    cout << "Hello, world!" << endl;
    // return 0 when program ran successfully
    return 0;
  } // end of main function
#+end_src

#+begin_notes
The only header arguments left are: =C++= for the language, =:results
output= to stream output to the screen, and =:exports both= to export
both source code and output (e.g. to LaTeX, Markdown or HTML).
#+end_notes

*** How can you run "Hello World" in C inside Emacs?
*** -----
#+begin_example C
#+begin_src C
  puts("Hello, World!");
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Hello, World!
#+end_example
Works because of the =#+property:= file header:
#+begin_example
  #+property: header-args:C :main yes :includes <stdio.h> :results output
#+end_example

#+begin_notes
To make use of it, you only need to open the file or run it with
=C-c C-c=. If you work with code that includes functions outside of
=main=, you need to change the header arguments. Example:

#+begin_src C :main no
  void hello(void); // prototype definition

  int main(void)
  {
    hello();
    return 0;
  }

  void hello(void)
  {
    puts("Hello, World!");
  }
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Hello, World!

*** What are the differences between C and C++ blocks?

| C++                  | C             |
|----------------------+---------------|
| =<iostream>=           | =<stdio.h>=     |
| =using namespace std=  |               |
| =cout <<= ... =<< endl;= | =puts("...");=  |
| header-args:C++      | header-args:C |

What does the =<>= mean in the =#include= statements?

*** Why are we using Emacs + Org-mode (not VSCode or Code::Blocks IDEs)?

- Customizability and extensibility
- Integrated file management and shell
- Literate programming support
- Powerful text editing environment

#+begin_notes
- While VSCode and Code::Blocks are excellent IDEs with their own
  strengths, Emacs + Org-mode provides a unique combination of
  customizability, integrated task management, support for literate
  programming, and a powerful text editing environment that can lead
  to a more efficient and personalized workflow, and that teaches you
  important file management and productivity techniques - with a much
  higher transfer value than other tools.

- Having mastered and used Emacs daily will give you an edge in the
  job market (esp for programming jobs) and you should mention it as
  "Literate Programming with Emacs/Org-mode" on your resume.

** GitHub - the world's largest development platform

*If you are in more than one of my courses, do this only once.*

- Premier software engineering platform
- I used it since 2010 for development
- Uses Git for development version control
- Used for code sharing and AI assisted coding

#+begin_notes

- GitHub is the premier software engineering platform. An early user
  (since 2010) I use it for course materials, but most users are
  software developers and teams who use Git for version control.

- Besides software development, you can also use it to share code
  snippets called "gists" (cp. [[https://gist.github.com/search?q=birkenkrahe][my gists]]), and (as students or paying
  pro subscribers) for AI-assisted code development ("[[https://github.com/codespaces][codespaces]]").
#+end_notes

*** GitHub Todo Now

1. Register with GitHub
2. Complete Hello World Exercise
3. Fork my course materials
4. Create public repo for your code
5. Submit screenshot of forked repo

#+begin_notes
- My course materials were always on GitHub (so that I can develop
  them on different computers and use it as a central Git-controlled
  hub). From fall'24, you'll take another step towards software
  engineering. You must:

  1) [[https://github.com/join][Register with GitHub]] (use your Lyon email address/Google) at
     [[https://github.com/join][github.com/join]]. You can use this registration with many
     coding-related sites as login.

  2) Complete (or re-do) the GitHub [[https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world][Hello World exercise]] in class. The
     repo that you create should be called =hello-world=, include a
     =README= file, a =.gitignore= C++ template, and the =GNU General
     Public License v3.0=. Writing the =README= will teach you to write
     Markdown and use the markdown editor. When you are done with the
     description, you "Commit changes..." to save the file.

  3) [[https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo][Fork my course materials]] from [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/alg1/tree/main][github.com/birkenkrahe/alg1]]. You
     find the "fork" option at the top of the dashboard. The owner of
     the forked repo will be notified. Whenever he makes changes, you
     can update your fork (that'll be almost daily in my case, at
     least during the term).

  4) [[https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository][Create a (public) repo]] for the code you generate in the course,
     change your avatar, edit your profile, customize your pins

  5) Submit a screenshot of your GitHub profile that shows the forked
     course repo, the hello-world repo, your (professional) profile
     pic and description, like this (=hello-world= is pinned).
     #+attr_html: :width 600px:
     [[../img/githubRepo.png]]
#+end_notes
*** How are you going to use GitHub?

- You'll regularly update your fork of my course repo.
- In this way you have automatic access to the latest materials.
- If you have a PC, you can install =git= and =clone= the repo.
- If you have Emacs, you can install =magit= and use Git that way.

#+begin_notes

6) Org-mode files from my repos are automatically rendered as markdown
   in GitHub on the desktop. Footnotes and special layout does not
   render well, and the mobile GitHub app does not render Org-mode at
   all.

7) What the Hello World exercise does not show you is how you use
   GitHub for your own code across *remote* locations as I do it. For
   that you need to *clone* your own repo to a remote computer. This is
   explained in the freeCodeCamp tutorial
   ([[https://tinyurl.com/guide-to-git][tinyurl.com/guide-to-git]]). There is also a short course (4 hr)
   [[https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-git]["Introduction to Git"]] and a [[https://www.datacamp.com/blog/all-about-git][short tutorial]].

8) How are you going to use GitHub?
   - You'll regularly update your fork of my course repo.
   - In this way you have automatic access to the latest materials.
   - If you have a PC, you can install =git= and =clone= the repo.
   - If you have Emacs, you can install =magit= and use Git that way.

9) Having used GitHub like a professional daily will give you an edge
   in the job market (esp. for software engineering jobs) and you
   should mention it (as "GitHub/Git") on your resume.

*** GitHub Hello World Exercise

1. Create hello-world repo and set it up
2. Create a branch
3. Make a commit changes
4. Open a pull request
5. Merge your pull request

#+begin_notes
You've got to be registered at GitHub (github.com/join). Open
github.com in your browser (Google Chrome is best) and login.

1. Step 1: Create hello-world repo and set it up

   - Click on your profile image in the upper right corner, and pick
     "Your repositories".
   - Click on the green "New" button to create a new repo
   - In the form, choose =hello-world= as repo name
   - Write a minimal description (="Hello World exercise for CSC 240"=)
   - Check ="Public"= (everybody can see this)
   - Check ="Add a README file"=
   - Choose the =.gitignore template: C++=
   - Choose the ="GNU General Public License v3.0"=
   - Click ="Create repository"= at the bottom of the page.
   - If you checked "Add a README file", the Markdown editor will open:
     enter a description (plain-text), then click on =Preview= to see how
     it will look like.
   - Click on the green ="Commit changes..."= button. A second window
     appears - make sure you check ="Commit directly to the ~main~ branch"=,
     and click on ="Commit changes"=.
   - Your repo appears with three auto-created files, =.gitignore=,
     =LICENSE=, and =README.md=.

2. Step 2: Create a branch
   - Go back to the exercise and continue with step 2. Make sure you read
     the explanation on what a "branch" exactly is. If this is Chinese to
     you (and you're not Chinese), check out the freeCodeCamp tutorial at
     [[https://tinyurl.com/guide-to-git][tinyurl.com/guide-to-git]].
   - Essentially, you're posing as a developer who creates a new branch
     called =readme-edits= besides the =main= branch. Once you've added the
     branch, you'll see both branches in the =Code= dashboard of your repo.

3. Step 3: Make and commit changes

   - You're now asked to make a change to your code base in the new
     branch using the =README.md= file (a change to any file would be
     equivalent).
   - Once you made the change, you commit it. You can make as many
     changes and commits as you like.
   - Your two branches, =main= and =readme-edits= have now diverged.

4. Step 4: Open a pull request

   - A "pull request" is a request for the maintainer of =main= to consider
     using your changes in the =main= code base. Follow the steps of the
     exercise.
   - After creating a =New pull request=, you can check out the changes
     in the well-known Linux "diff" format, a line-by-line comparison.

5. Step 5: merge your pull request

   - The GitHub dashboards seem a little crowded. When you ="View the pull
     request"=, you find the ="Merge pull request"= button, and since the
     branches do not report a "conflict", you can go ahead and merge.
   - The pull request is now closed. You can delete the =readme-edits=
     branch (e.g. by clicking on the branch symbol next to the branch
     name in the repo dashboard).
   - Now go back to your profile, find =Customize your pins= and pin
     =hello-world= to the profile as you see it on my GitHub profile.

#+end_notes

* Summary I

- You only need basic programming skills to succeed in this course.
- There will be 2 programming assignments and 1 quiz per week, with
  an optional final exam.
- We will make excessive use of Linux, Emacs + Org-mode, and GitHub.
- We will mostly use the C programming language

* Summary II

- We will review several derived data types: pointers, functions,
  structures, unions and enums
- You will learn common data structures: arrays, linked lists, stacks,
  queues, trees, graphs and hash tables.
- You don't need to buy a textbook for this course but the book by
  King (C Programming 2e, W W Norton 2008) is worth having anyway.
