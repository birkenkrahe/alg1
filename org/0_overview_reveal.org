* Questions with Answers

** What if you don't know C or C++?

- Any introductory programming class is OK
- Complete the entry quiz (Aug 19, 11:50pm)
- Weaknesses: freeCodeCamp (3h) / The Rook's Guide to C++ (100p)

#+begin_notes
You should have taken introductory programming in Java or Python or
C/C++: Both Java and Python are high-level languages, but C++ is
quite different (and quite a bit more complicated, too).

Make sure you take the (optional ) entry quiz and complete the
(optional) entry programming assignment if you didn't do it yet. If
you meet the August 19, 11:50 pm deadline, you get some bonus
points, too.

If you have any weaknesses in the basics (or if you haven't studied
C++ yet at all), read "The Rook's Guide to C++" for free and answer
the review questions. Sample solutions available online in GitHub.

Otherwise we'll be reviewing (and adding to) our knowledge of C/C++
in the first 4 weeks of the course (including some OOP aspects).
#+end_notes
** Will I be able to work on this course from home?

- You can use your personal virtual Linux box from anywhere
- You can install Linux via dual boot or as WSL (Windows)
- Use GitHub as a central repo and clone to local machine

#+begin_notes
Absolutely. You'll be using a personal virtual Linux box on our
dedicated Lyon computer and data science server, and you can login
to this system from anywhere as long as you've got an Internet
connection.

If that doesn't work for you for whatever reason (connection,
convenience etc.) then you can easily install Linux via dual boot,
as a virtual machine on your PC, or on Windows with the WSL
system. On MacOS, you have a form of Unix already, so you're set.

In this case, you can put your GitHub skills to good use: create a
repository for this course where you keep the latest version of all
your files, and clone it to your local PC. This is what I do, too:
I'm working on my files in different locations, and I use Git to
maintain the latest version on any machine at any time.
#+end_notes
** Why did you choose C/C++ for "data structures"?

- C/C++ is compiled & much faster than Python or R
- Offers memory allocation and freeing control
- C/C++ have large Standard (Template) Libraries
- Used in industry for performance-critical apps

#+begin_notes
I did not choose it, the catalog (and wiser, older professors
before me) did. But I'm on board with it for a number of reasons:
- C/C++ is *compiled* (unlike Python) and offers high performance,
  which you need for big data and *complex* algorithms (like machine
  learning).
- C/C++ offers explicit *control* over memory allocation and
  deallocation, which is essential to know how data structures work
  under the hood.
- C++ in particular has a Standard Template Library (STL) which
  offers template classes for *common* data structures (vectors,
  lists, queues, stacks) and algorithms, which saves time and helps
  you learn.
- C/C++ is used in industry for performance-*critical* applications
  (like large-scale multi-player network games, network
  communication, or space exploration and communications).
#+end_notes
** But most programs are in C not in C++ - why is that?

- Object-orientation adds layers of abstraction
- Language should not get in the way of problem solving
- Once you get it in C, you can take your knowledge anywhere

#+begin_notes
After working out many lectures in C++ only, I realized that
Object-orientation and the extra layers of abstraction that C++
brings, are actually in the way of understanding the essence of
data structures.

This essence is not "what can this language do?" but "how can you
store, organize, and access data to solve a given problem most
efficiently." This question is largely language-independent, and so
we want that the language does not get in the way to our solving
problems algorithmically.

The arguments given by Zingaro in favor of C in his 2024 book
"Algorithmic Thinking" resonated with me, too. Once you understand
this stuff in C, you can take your knowledge anywhere, to any other
language, wherever problems can be solved computationally.

#+end_notes
** What are your favorite programming languages?

- Lisp (Emacs - 1980s)
- C++ (computational physics - 1990s)
- SQL (databases - 2005)
- R (data science - 2019)
- Python (machine learning - 2022)

#+begin_notes
Though I have (passing) knowledge of many programming languages,
C/C++, Python, SQL and Lisp are becoming my main go-to languages
for performance (C++), data science (Python), database applications
(SQL), and Emacs customization (Lisp).

R is great for visualization and stats, and was another one of my
favorite languages but it is slowly falling out of my quality world
because of the dominance of the "Tidyverse" ([[https://github.com/matloff/TidyverseSkeptic][see here]]). The data
science intro courses are however still in R (with some Python).

I learnt these languages at different times in my life: Lisp
because of Emacs (late 1980s), C++ in the 1990s, SQL in 2005, R in
2019, and Python in 2022. C++ has developed massively since then
though and I am more comfortable with its subset C than with many
of the modern developments of the language - but I'm keen to learn!
#+end_notes
** Why did you not choose Python given that it's the most popular programming language?

- Python consumes 76 x more energy than C
- Python is 72 x slower than C
- Python abstracts memory management away

#+begin_notes
Python has some serious deficiencies compared to C/C++, most
importantly speed. Here is an interesting paper that shows that
Python consumes 76 times more energy and is 72 times slower than C.
#+attr_html: :width 400px:
[[../img/python_vs_C.png]]
But more importantly for the purpose of learning about data
structures: Python abstracts away many details such as memory
management, which are crucial to understanding why to choose one
data structure over another. C gives you much more control over
system resources. The only real reason to pick Python is that it's
easier to learn and use.

But at the end of the day, it's a personal decision. In my case,
I'm also better at C than Python, and I like the control it gives.
#+end_notes
** What's the difference between C, C++ and C#?
#+attr_html: :width 800px:
[[../img/c_vs_cpp_vs_c_hash.png]]

#+begin_notes
The list shows the simplicity of C vs. C++ vs. C#, and the
independence on complicated paradigms and commercial solutions -
which translates into deeper understanding and freedom from fads.

Here is a [[https://youtu.be/sNMtjs_wQiE?si=yI86h-gvonkJ5gDG][short video]] that summarizes C vs. C++ vs. C# (conaticus,
2022). And here is [[https://youtu.be/juKv1aHEikI?si=lrEIoJb11ABAz38h][another one]] by a YouTuber who specializes in
coding interview preparation, and who prefers C because it is
devoid of external dependencies - essentially useful on its own
(NeedCode, 2024).
#+end_notes

** Can this course help me break into Game Programming?

- Data structures and algorithms enhance performance
- Speed is critical for (multiplayer) games
- C/C# more directly relevant

#+begin_notes
Only in so far as data structures and algorithms are performance
enhancing choices, which are critical when programming games. Other
than that, C++ and C# are more directly relevant for game
development.
#+end_notes

** Can this course help me break into Cybersecurity?

- Emacs = hacker editor
- Linux = server operating system
- C = system programming language

#+begin_notes
Absolutely: the mixture of Emacs + Linux + C is the winning
solution for cybersecurity.
#+end_notes

** How should you study for this course?

- Code every day and participate actively
- Complete assignments early and expand them
- Focus on fundamentals, simple examples, drills
- Build a code & notebook repo on GitHub

#+begin_notes
1) Code every day no matter how little.
2) Review lecture notes and notebooks.
3) Participate actively in the class.
4) Form study groups and/or join Lyon's Programming Club.
5) Complete assignments well before the deadline.
6) Practice literate programming by documenting your process.
7) Focus on fundamentals, simple examples, solid understanding.
8) Drill yourself using the weekly quizzes, make small examples.
9) Seek help when needed, on the chat or during office hours.
10) Build a code & notebook repository at GitHub for your resume.

* Course content - Data Types and Data Structures

This is a vast topic. If you're anything like me, you like a clear
roadmap with code examples. So here's all of what we'll cover in the
briefest form possible, including definitions + code.

** Data Types

Data types classify the type of data a variable can hold, and the
operations that can be performed on it.

** Primitive Data Types

- =int=: Integer type
- =float=: Floating-point type
- =double=: Double-precision floating-point type
- =char=: Character type
- =void=: Special purpose type

** Derived Data Types

*** *Array*: Collection of elements of the same type
#+begin_src C  :results none
  int arr[10];
#+end_src
*** *Function*: Represents a function
#+begin_src C  :results none
  int func(int, float);
#+end_src
*** *Pointer*: Stores the address of another variable
#+begin_src C :results none
  int *ptr;
#+end_src
*** *Structure*: Groups variables of different types
#+begin_src C  :results none
  struct Person {
    char name[50];
    int age;
  };
#+end_src
*** *Union*: Similar to structures, but with shared memory
#+begin_src C  :results none
  union Data {
    int i;
    float f;
    char str[20];
  };
#+end_src
*** *Enumeration*: Consists of named integer constants
#+begin_src C  :results none
  enum Color {RED, GREEN, BLUE};
#+end_src

** Data Structures

Data structures organize and store data for efficient access and
modification.

*** *Arrays*: Collection of elements of the same type
#+begin_src C :results none
  int arr[10];
#+end_src
*** *Linked Lists*: Each element points to the next element
#+begin_src C :results none
  struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node *next;
  };
#+end_src
*** *Stacks*: Follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle
#+begin_src C :results none
  #define MAX 100
  int stack[MAX];
  int top = -1;
#+end_src
*** *Queues*: Follows the FIFO (First In First Out) principle
#+begin_src C :results none
  #define MAX 100
  int queue[MAX];
  int front = -1, rear = -1;
#+end_src
*** *Trees*: Hierarchical data structure
#+begin_src C :results none
  struct TreeNode {
    int data;
    struct TreeNode *left;
    struct TreeNode *right;
  };
#+end_src
*** *Graphs*: Collection of nodes and edges
#+begin_src C :results none
  struct Graph {
    int numVertices;
    int *adjMatrix;
  };
#+end_src
*** *Hash Tables*: Implements an associative array
#+begin_src C :results none
  struct HashTable {
    int size;
    int *table;
  };
#+end_src

* Development tools

This section is shared across my courses. Apologies if you have to
hear/do it twice but remember: imitation/repetition creates mastery!

** Pep talk for developers

- Computer & data science = "maker spaces"
- 15 minutes per day beats 1 hour per week
- Professionals rely on good toolkits

#+begin_notes
- Computer and data science courses are "maker spaces": you're
  supposed to make stuff rather than only listen and be passive. Your
  "making" is "developing software", and flex your programming
  muscles. It's like weight training or running: 15 minutes per day
  beats 1 hour once a week.

- In computer and data science, your professional development is only
  as good as your toolkit. Your toolkit for this course includes:
  1) The Linux operating system and the shell
  2) The Emacs editor with the Org-mode package
  3) The GitHub software engineering platform

#+end_notes

** Linux - the world's premier OS

- Linux server for exclusive use by CS and DS
- If you had CSC 420 (OS) you're well prepared
- You get your own Ubuntu LTS 22.04 system
- Access from anywhere with Internet
- Daily use = edge in job market

#+begin_notes
- A summer research grant 2024, and the gracious professional support
  of Lyon's IT Services enabled us to establish a Linux server for
  exclusive use in computer and data science courses.

- If you completed my Operating Systems course or if you were exposed
  to Linux in some other way (e.g. via WSL, the Windows Subsystem for
  Linux), you know more than enough Linux to feel comfortable.

- For the duration of the term, you get your own virtual Linux PC
  running Ubuntu LTS 22.04. This is where we will do all our
  work. Emacs, R, Python, C++, SQLite are pre-installed on your PC.

- You can access this PC from anywhere with an Internet connection.

- Having used Linux daily will give you an edge in the job market (esp
  for server-related jobs), and you should mention it on your resume.

#+end_notes
** Emacs - the world's most customizable hacking power tool

- You've most likely worked with Emacs + Org-mode and the literate
  programming approach in my other data science or computing courses.

- Test your memory with a few review questions:

  1. What is special about Emacs?
     #+begin_quote
     *Emacs* is a self-extensible, free, open source editor written in a
     Lisp dialect, and first published in the 1980s by Richard
     Stallman. It is a hacker- and power-user tool because of its
     customizability and openess. The vanilla version can be
     downloaded from [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs][gnu.org/software/emacs]]. Famous applications:
     [[https://orgmode.org][Org-mode]] (for literate programming) and [[https://magit.vc/][magit]] (for
     Git). Additional resource: [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/refcard.pdf][Emacs Reference Card]].
     #+end_quote

  2. What is Org-mode?
     #+begin_quote
     *Org-mode* is an Emacs mode (plugin or extension package) for
     plain-text note-taking, task management, documentation. It was
     first released in 2003 by Carsten Dominik. More information at
     [[https://orgmode.org/][orgmode.org]]. Famous application: [[http://literateprogramming.com/][literate programming]],
     [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-spreadsheet-intro.html][spreadsheets]]. Additional resource: [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/orgcard.pdf][Org-mode Reference Card]].
     #+end_quote

  3. What is Literate Programming?
     #+begin_quote
     *Literate Programming* is a programming paradigm introduced by
     Donald Knuth in the 1970[fn:1]. It emphasises writing code and
     documentation together to make programs better structured and
     more enjoyable to read and understand by humans. More information
     at [[http://literateprogramming.com/][literateprogramming.com]].  Famous application: The [[https://www.ctan.org/starter][TeX]]
     typesetting system, which dominates technical and scientific
     publishing.
     #+end_quote
  4. How can you run the "Hello World" program in C++ inside Emacs?
     #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both
       cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
     #+end_src
     This code chunk is a souped-up (by way of header arguments)
     version of this complete program:
     #+begin_src C++ :results output :exports both
       // include input/output library
       #include <iostream>
       // use standard namespace for cout, endl
       using namespace std;
       int main() { // begin of main function
         // stream string to standard output then print newline
         cout << "Hello, world!" << endl;
         // return 0 when program ran successfully
         return 0;
       } // end of main function
     #+end_src
     The only header arguments left are: =C++= for the language,
     =:results output= to stream output to the screen, and =:exports both=
     to export both source code and output (e.g. to LaTeX, Markdown or
     HTML).

  5. How can you run "Hello World" in C inside Emacs?
     #+begin_src C
       puts("Hello, World!");
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : Hello, World!

     This code chunk works only because of the =#+property:= header at
     the top of the file:
     #+begin_example
       #+property: header-args:C :main yes :includes <stdio.h> :results output
     #+end_example

     To make use of it, you only need to open the file or run it with
     =C-c C-c=. If you work with code that includes functions outside of
     =main=, you need to change the header arguments. Example:

     #+begin_src C :main no
       void hello(void); // prototype definition

       int main(void)
       {
         hello();
         return 0;
       }

       void hello(void)
       {
         puts("Hello, World!");
       }
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : Hello, World!

     Nt

  6. What are the differences between the C and the C++ versions?
     #+begin_quote
     | C++                  | C             |
     |----------------------+---------------|
     | =<iostream>=           | =<stdio.h>=     |
     | =using namespace std=  | [fn:2]        |
     | =cout <<= ... =<< endl;= | =puts("...");=  |
     | header-args:C++      | header-args:C |

     What does the =<>= mean in the =#include= statements?[fn:3]
     #+end_quote

  7. Why are we using Emacs + Org-mode instead of the VSCode or
     Code::Blocks IDEs?
     #+begin_quote
     While VSCode and Code::Blocks are excellent IDEs with their own
     strengths, Emacs + Org-mode provides a unique combination of
     customizability, integrated task management, support for literate
     programming, and a powerful text editing environment that can
     lead to a more efficient and personalized workflow, and that
     teaches you important file management and productivity
     techniques - with a much higher transfer value than other tools.
     #+end_quote

- Having mastered and used Emacs daily will give you an edge in the
  job market (esp for programming jobs) and you should mention it as
  "Literate Programming with Emacs/Org-mode" on your resume.

** GitHub - the world's largest development platform

*[If you are in more than one of my courses, do this only once.]*

- GitHub is the premier software engineering platform. An early user
  (since 2010) I use it for course materials, but most users are
  software developers and teams who use Git for version control.

- Besides software development, you can also use it to share code
  snippets called "gists" (cp. [[https://gist.github.com/search?q=birkenkrahe][my gists]]), and (as students or paying
  pro subscribers) for AI-assisted code development ("[[https://github.com/codespaces][codespaces]]").

- My course materials were always on GitHub (so that I can develop
  them on different computers and use it as a central Git-controlled
  hub). From fall'24, you'll take another step towards software
  engineering. You must:

  1) [[https://github.com/join][Register with GitHub]] (use your Lyon email address/Google) at
     [[https://github.com/join][github.com/join]]. You can use this registration with many
     coding-related sites as login.

  2) Complete (or re-do) the GitHub [[https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world][Hello World exercise]] in class. The
     repo that you create should be called =hello-world=, include a
     =README= file, a =.gitignore= C++ template, and the =GNU General
     Public License v3.0=. Writing the =README= will teach you to write
     Markdown and use the markdown editor. When you are done with the
     description, you "Commit changes..." to save the file.

  3) [[https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo][Fork my course materials]] from [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/alg1/tree/main][github.com/birkenkrahe/alg1]]. You
     find the "fork" option at the top of the dashboard. The owner of
     the forked repo will be notified. Whenever he makes changes, you
     can update your fork (that'll be almost daily in my case, at
     least during the term).

  4) [[https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository][Create a (public) repo]] for the code you generate in the course,
     change your avatar, edit your profile, customize your pins

  5) Submit a screenshot of your GitHub profile that shows the forked
     course repo, the hello-world repo, your (professional) profile
     pic and description, like this (=hello-world= is pinned).
     #+attr_html: :width 600px:
     [[../img/githubRepo.png]]

  6) Org-mode files from my repos are automatically rendered as markdown
     in GitHub on the desktop. Footnotes and special layout does not
     render well, and the mobile GitHub app does not render Org-mode at
     all.

  7) What the Hello World exercise does not show you is how you use
     GitHub for your own code across *remote* locations as I do it. For
     that you need to *clone* your own repo to a remote computer. This is
     explained in the freeCodeCamp tutorial
     ([[https://tinyurl.com/guide-to-git][tinyurl.com/guide-to-git]]). There is also a short course (4 hr)
     [[https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-git]["Introduction to Git"]][fn:4] and a [[https://www.datacamp.com/blog/all-about-git][short tutorial]].

  8) How are you going to use GitHub?
     - You'll regularly update your fork of my course repo.
     - In this way you have automatic access to the latest materials.
     - If you have a PC, you can install =git= and =clone= the repo.
     - If you have Emacs, you can install =magit= and use Git that way.

  9) Having used GitHub like a professional daily will give you an edge
     in the job market (esp. for software engineering jobs) and you
     should mention it (as "GitHub/Git") on your resume.

*** GitHub Hello World Exercise

You've got to be registered at GitHub (github.com/join). Open
github.com in your browser (Google Chrome is best) and login.

**** Step 1: Create hello-world repo and set it up

- Click on your profile image in the upper right corner, and pick
  "Your repositories".
- Click on the green "New" button to create a new repo
- In the form, choose =hello-world= as repo name
- Write a minimal description (="Hello World exercise for CSC 240"=)
- Check ="Public"= (everybody can see this)
- Check ="Add a README file"=
- Choose the =.gitignore template: C++=
- Choose the ="GNU General Public License v3.0"=
- Click ="Create repository"= at the bottom of the page.
- If you checked "Add a README file", the Markdown editor will open:
  enter a description (plain-text), then click on =Preview= to see how
  it will look like[fn:5].
- Click on the green ="Commit changes..."= button. A second window
  appears - make sure you check ="Commit directly to the ~main~ branch"=,
  and click on ="Commit changes"=.
- Your repo appears with three auto-created files, =.gitignore=,
  =LICENSE=, and =README.md=[fn:6].

**** Step 2: Create a branch
- Go back to the exercise and continue with step 2. Make sure you read
  the explanation on what a "branch" exactly is. If this is Chinese to
  you (and you're not Chinese), check out the freeCodeCamp tutorial at
  [[https://tinyurl.com/guide-to-git][tinyurl.com/guide-to-git]].
- Essentially, you're posing as a developer who creates a new branch
  called =readme-edits= besides the =main= branch. Once you've added the
  branch, you'll see both branches in the =Code= dashboard of your repo.

**** Step 3: Make and commit changes

- You're now asked to make a change to your code base in the new
  branch using the =README.md= file (a change to any file would be
  equivalent).
- Once you made the change, you commit it[fn:7]. You can make as many
  changes and commits as you like.
- Your two branches, =main= and =readme-edits= have now diverged.

**** Step 4: Open a pull request

- A "pull request" is a request for the maintainer of =main= to consider
  using your changes in the =main= code base. Follow the steps of the
  exercise.
- After creating a =New pull request=, you can check out the changes in
  the well-known Linux "diff" format[fn:8], a line-by-line comparison.

**** Step 5: merge your pull request

- The GitHub dashboards seem a little crowded. When you ="View the pull
  request"=, you find the ="Merge pull request"= button, and since the
  branches do not report a "conflict", you can go ahead and merge.
- The pull request is now closed. You can delete the =readme-edits=
  branch (e.g. by clicking on the branch symbol next to the branch
  name in the repo dashboard).
- Now go back to your profile, find =Customize your pins= and pin
  =hello-world= to the profile as you see it on my GitHub profile.

* Summary

- You only need basic programming skills to succeed in this course.
- There will be 2 programming assignments and 1 quiz per week, with
  an optional final exam.
- We will make excessive use of Linux, Emacs + Org-mode, and GitHub.
- We will mostly use the C programming language
- We will review several derived data types: pointers, functions,
  structures, unions and enums
- You will learn common data structures: arrays, linked lists, stacks,
  queues, trees, graphs and hash tables.
- You don't need to buy a textbook for this course but the book by
  King (C Programming 2e, W W Norton 2008) is worth having anyway.

* Footnotes

[fn:1]Literate Programming "Knuth-style" is a little different from
what we're doing. You'll see it in some lectures and assignment sample
solutions, when I use the =noweb= macro processor to split code into
small pieces and link them back together later.

[fn:2]C does not have namespaces like C++ to encapsulate names and
organize code, instead it has prefixes, =static=, and =struct= objects to
avoid name conflicts and group related functions and variables.

[fn:3]It means that the header file or library is in the computers
=PATH=, the set of locations where the computer looks for
programs. Alternatively, you need to put the complete (absolute) path
to the file in between ="..."=.

[fn:4]Lyon College has a classroom at DataCamp, and if you're
enrolled, you can ask me to get access to this online
platform. DataCamp is not for C++ but for SQL, Python and R, as well
as for tools like Git and the shell.

[fn:5]Markdown is simple layout language: for example =#= gives you a
headline, =`= (backtick) choose code font, =*= gives you bold face, and =_=
gives you italics.

[fn:6]Explanation: =.gitignore= contains file types that Git will
ignore - especially those created in the process of compiling C++
code - you can add other file types here, e.g. =*.*~= for backup, or
=*.html= for HTML files; the LICENSE specifies the copyright for
everything in your repo; the =README.md= file is markdown with a
description of the repository.

[fn:7]On the shell, the equivalent =git= command is =git commit -m
"[message]"= following a =git add .= for all changed files. To push a
commit to the remote code base (=origin=), use =git push=.

[fn:8]That's not a coincidence: both Linux and Git were created by
Linus Torvalds, a Finnish programmer and (still) leader of the global
Linux kernel development
