Just enough to be able to follow the rest of the course!

You should code along for a large part of this lecture!

* The Structure of a Basic C++ Program

- What is required to create and run a C++ program?
  #+begin_quote
  1. An editor to create the source code (like Emacs).
  2. A compiler to turn the source code into executable code (like GCC).
  3. A linker to link libraries (like =iostream=) to the source code file.
  4. A shell (or an IDE with a shell) to run the executable (like =bash=).
  #+end_quote

- What must every C++ program have?
  #+begin_quote
  A =main= function. Optional: Preprocessor directives (like =#include=).
  #+end_quote

* A first C++ program in six incarnations

For this section, fire up Emacs, open a file (~C-x C-f first.org RET)~
and code along. To create a C++ code block, enter ~<s TAB C++~.

1) Example: "Hello world" program - can you explain every line?
   #+begin_src C++ :results output :exports both
     #include <cstdio>

     int main() {

       printf("Hello, world!");

       return 0;
     }
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Hello, world!

2) A good habit: Provide ample comments (espcially at the beginning)
   #+begin_src C++ :results output :exports both
     /* --------------------------------------------*/
     /* Print a string to a standard output device  */
     /* --------------------------------------------*/
     // include standard input/output library
     #include <cstdio>
     // main program
     int main() {  // return integer, take no argument (void)
       // print string
       printf("Hello, world!");
       // return 0 if successful
       return 0;
     } // end of main program
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Hello, world!

3) Here is another version: What's different?
   #+begin_src C++ :results output :exports both
     /* --------------------------------------------*/
     /* Print a string to a standard output device  */
     /* Use character array and formatted printing  */
     /* --------------------------------------------*/
     #include <cstdio>
     // main program
     int main() {  // return integer, take no argument (void)
       // declare and initialize character array
       char greeting[] = {"Hello, world!"};
       // print string
       printf("%s\n", greeting);
       // return 0 if successful
       return 0;
     } // end of main program
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Hello, world!

4) And another version: What's different?
   #+begin_src C++ :results output :exports both
     /* --------------------------------------------*/
     /* Print a string to a standard output device  */
     /* Use iostream and stream extraction cout <<  */
     /* --------------------------------------------*/
     #include <iostream>
     // main program
     int main() {  // return integer, take no argument (void)
       // print string
       std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl;
       // return 0 if successful
       return 0;
     } // end of main program
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Hello, world!

5) With the magic of Emacs + Org-mode, one could almost believe that
   C++ was Python or R - what's different?
   #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :tangle hw.cpp :results output :exports both
     // print string to standard output device
     cout << "Hello, world!" << endl;
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Hello, world!

6) Literate programming: The last code block can be "tangled" into
   source code:
   #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
     cat hw.cpp
   #+end_src

7) The source code file can be compiled and run on the command line (or
   in a shell in this Org-mode file):
   #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
     g++ -o hello hw.cpp
     ./hello
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Hello, world!

* =main=

- All C++ programs have a single entry point called the =main= function.

- Functions are blocks of code that can take input and return results:
  #+begin_src C++ :tangle hw2.cpp :main no :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both
    void hello() { // function declaration and definition
      cout << "hello" << endl;
    }
    main() { // program entry point
      hello();  // function call
    }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : hello

- Look at the tangled file:
  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
    cat hw2.cpp
  #+end_src

- When you define your own functions (or classes and their member
  functions), you need to declare them before =main= (you can define
  them later).

- In this code, ~hello~ is declared as a prototype, and defined later:
  #+begin_src C++ :tangle hw2.cpp :main no :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both
    void hello(); // function declaration (prototype)

    int main() { // program entry point
      hello();  // function call
      return 0;
    }

    void hello() { // function definition
      cout << "hello" << endl;
    }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : hello

* =#include=

- Most programming languages incorporate library functions. Libraries
  are often sizeable and must be installed, sometimes compiled from
  source, and they're linked to the language version used.

- Python, Go and Java have =import=. Here's a Python example:
  #+begin_src python :results output :session *Python* :python python3 :exports both
    import numpy # import library (install with `pip`)
    [print(_) for _ in globals()]
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  #+begin_example
  __name__
  __doc__
  __package__
  __loader__
  __spec__
  __annotations__
  __builtins__
  codecs
  os
  __pyfile
  __code
  __org_babel_python_format_value
  __PYTHON_EL_native_completion_setup
  f
  np
  x
  math
  numpy
  #+end_example

- R has =library=:
  #+begin_src R :session *R* :results output :exports both
    library(MASS) # import stats library (install with `install.packages`
    search()
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : [1] ".GlobalEnv"        "package:MASS"      "ESSR"              "package:stats"    
  :  [5] "package:graphics"  "package:grDevices" "package:utils"     "package:datasets" 
  :  [9] "package:methods"   "Autoloads"         "package:base"

- Rust and C# have =use=, JavaScript, Lua, Perl and PHP have =require=,
  and C/C++ have =include=.

- In the C++ examples so far, we included =iostream= (for =cout= and =<<=),
  and =cstdio= (for =printf=).

- The command =#include= is only one of many possible /preprocessor/
  directives

* =namespace=

- Namespaces prevent naming conflicts. For example, when importing
  libraries, namespaces are essential for identifying symbols.

- The keyword =cout= to direct output to standard output devices (like a
  screen) is defined in the =std= namespace ('standard'). Its full name
  is therefore =std::cout=.

- You can employ a =using= (preprocessor) directive to avoid a lot of
  typing:
  #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :results output :exports both
    using namespace std;
    cout << "Much shorter than..." << endl;
    std::cout << "...this statement." << std::endl;    
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Much shorter than...
  : ...this statement.
  
- This is the same thing that's going on when using =import= in Python
  and choosing an alias:
  #+begin_src python :results output :session *Python* :python python3 :exports both
    import random
  #+end_src

* Summary


** Presentation of Content (20 minutes)
*** C++ Syntax


#+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both
  int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
    return 0;
  }
#+end_src

*** Variables and Data Types

- Variables store data values in memory
- Variables must be declared before they can be used.
- Basic data types: =int=, =float=, =double=, =char=, =bool=

#+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both
  int main() {
    int age = 25;
    float height = 5.9;
    double pi = 3.14159;
    char grade = 'A';
    bool is_student = true;

    cout << "Age: " << age << endl;
    cout << "Height: " << height << endl;
    cout << "Pi: " << pi << endl;
    cout << "Grade: " << grade << endl;
    cout << "Is Student: " << is_student << endl;

    return 0;
  }
#+end_src

*** Operators
- Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, %
- Comparison operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
- Logical operators: &&, ||, !

#+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both
  int main() {
    int a = 10, b = 20;
    cout << "a + b = " << (a + b) << endl;
    cout << "a - b = " << (a - b) << endl;
    cout << "a * b = " << (a * b) << endl;
    cout << "a / b = " << (a / b) << endl;
    cout << "a % b = " << (a % b) << endl;

    cout << "a == b: " << (a == b) << endl;
    cout << "a != b: " << (a != b) << endl;
    cout << "a > b: " << (a > b) << endl;
    cout << "a < b: " << (a < b) << endl;

    bool result = (a < b) && (b > 15);
    cout << "(a < b) && (b > 15): " << result << endl;

    return 0;
  }
#+end_src

** Practice Exercises (30 minutes)

- Write a program to declare and initialize variables of different
  (fundamental or primitive) data types and print them.
