** Presentation of Content (20 minutes)
*** C++ Syntax


#+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both
  int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
    return 0;
  }
#+end_src

*** Variables and Data Types

- Variables store data values in memory
- Variables must be declared before they can be used.
- Basic data types: =int=, =float=, =double=, =char=, =bool=

#+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both
  int main() {
    int age = 25;
    float height = 5.9;
    double pi = 3.14159;
    char grade = 'A';
    bool is_student = true;

    cout << "Age: " << age << endl;
    cout << "Height: " << height << endl;
    cout << "Pi: " << pi << endl;
    cout << "Grade: " << grade << endl;
    cout << "Is Student: " << is_student << endl;

    return 0;
  }
#+end_src

*** Operators
- Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, %
- Comparison operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
- Logical operators: &&, ||, !

#+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both
  int main() {
    int a = 10, b = 20;
    cout << "a + b = " << (a + b) << endl;
    cout << "a - b = " << (a - b) << endl;
    cout << "a * b = " << (a * b) << endl;
    cout << "a / b = " << (a / b) << endl;
    cout << "a % b = " << (a % b) << endl;

    cout << "a == b: " << (a == b) << endl;
    cout << "a != b: " << (a != b) << endl;
    cout << "a > b: " << (a > b) << endl;
    cout << "a < b: " << (a < b) << endl;

    bool result = (a < b) && (b > 15);
    cout << "(a < b) && (b > 15): " << result << endl;

    return 0;
  }
#+end_src

** Practice Exercises (30 minutes)

- Write a program to declare and initialize variables of different
  (fundamental or primitive) data types and print them.

- Write this as an Emacs .org file with a header (substitute [...]):
  #+begin_example
  #+TITLE: [title]
  #+AUTHOR: [your name] (pledged)
  #+SUBTITLE: [class and topic]
  #+end_example  

*** Solution:

See file: tinyurl.com/alg1-first

Fundamental data types in C++ are: integer =int=, floating-point =float=
and =double=, character =char=, and Boolean =bool=.

#+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both
    
#+end_src

- Create a simple calculator program using arithmetic operators

  Solution:

- Compare two integers using comparison operators and print the
  results

  Solution:

- Combine logical operators to evaluate and print the truth value of
  expressions

  Solution:

** Q&A and Discussion (15 minutes)
- Open floor for questions and clarifications
- Discuss common issues faced during practice exercises
- Provide additional examples or explanations as needed
