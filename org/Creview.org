* Overview

- 10 areas representing the basic aspects of any high-level
  programming language.
  
- Programming examples are in C. Extension to C++ is trivial since C
  is a subset of C++.

- You can also use DataCamp's courses "Introduction to Python" and
  "Intermediate Python" for a different approach (same topics, more
  data structures).

- Recommended:
  1. Book: [[https://bitwisebooks.com/books/little-book-of-c/][The Little Book of C by Huw Collingbourne]] (also Udemy)
  2. Online tutorial: [[https://www.w3schools.com/c/c_intro.php][W3schools C Introduction]]
  3. Video tutorial: [[https://youtu.be/KJgsSFOSQv0?si=_4YjHr8_u8yXGC4o][freeCodeCamp's C in 4 hours]]

- To code use Emacs + Org-mode, [[https://www.onlinegdb.com][onlinegdb.com]], or [[https://cloud.google.com/shell][Google Cloud Shell]].

- To test your skills, use problems from leetcode.com or dmoj.ca or
  check out the assignments for CSC 100 ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/cpp/tree/main/org/assignments][github.com/birkenkrahe/cpp]]).
