* Week 1

This week we met for our first session to get (re)acquainted with one
another, begin to learn about data structures, and understand what the
course is about.

** Why is the maximum number for a =char= type =127= and what does that mean?

It means that the computer can represent 127 characters, including
lower- and upper-case alphanumeric characters like ='a'= and ='A'=,
symbols like =+=, punctuation like =!=, and special characters like
newline, carriage return etc.

The maximum value is a constant stored in =limits.h=:
#+begin_src C :includes <float.h> <limits.h> <stdio.h>
  printf("%d\n", SCHAR_MAX);
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 127

=127= is the maximum because the ASCII standard historically uses 7
bits - with 7 bits, each bit has two values so you can represent
2^7=128 different values, from 0 to 127.

To print the ASCII value of a character, print it with the =%d= format
specifier reserved for =int= (integer) values:
#+begin_src C :main yes :includes <stdio.h>
  printf("%d %d %d\n",'a','A','\\'); // the `\` must be escaped to be
  // printed as a character
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 97 65 64

Later, an 8-th bit was added to extend the character set to 2^8 = 256
so that special symbols (like German umlauts =ü=, or the German =ß=) could
be represented.


* Week 2

** Syllabus: About Using AI to write code for you or debug your code

I'm feeling quite strongly about this - [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/fall24/UsingAItoCode.org][here are my views]], which I
also attached to the syllabus.

** Review questions

1. Do you remember any differences between C, C++, and C#?
   #+begin_quote
   For example:
   - C allows you to manage your computer's memory directly, and was
     developed in the 1970s.
   - C++ is an Object-Oriented extension of C,and was developed in
     the 1980.
   - C# was developed by Microsoft for commercial applications, and
     was developed in the early 2000s.

2. What is a reason to use C in a course on data structures?
   #+begin_quote
   C is small and basic, and does not have many layers of abstractions
   (aka complex concepts) so that you can see and use data structures
   more directly.
   #+end_quote

3. What is the computing infrastructure that we use in this course?
   #+begin_quote
   1. GitHub
   2. Linux
   3. Emacs
   #+end_quote

4. What does it mean that the maximum value for a =char= data type is =127=?
   #+begin_quote
   It means that the computer can represent 127 characters, including
   lower- and upper-case alphanumeric characters like ='a'= and ='A'=,
   symbols like =+=, punctuation like =!=, and special characters like
   newline, carriage return etc.

   =127= is the maximum because the ASCII standard historically uses 7
   bits - with 7 bits, each bit has two values so you can represent
   =2^7=128= different values, from 0 to 127.

5. What are C's primitive (or built-in) data types?
   #+begin_quote
   - Integer (=int=)
   - Floating-point (=float= or =double=)
   - Character (=char=)
   - Void (=void=)
   #+end_quote
