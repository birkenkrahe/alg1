- This lecture covers strings in C. Strings are arrays of characters
  terminated by a null character (`\0`). The C programming language
  provides various functions and techniques for manipulating and
  working with strings.

- In class, we'll be working with a wiki-type summary and interactive
  exercises. This section is accompanied by one bonus and by one
  mandatory programming assignment, as well as an online test.

- Much of this is based on King, C Programming (2008), chapter 13.
