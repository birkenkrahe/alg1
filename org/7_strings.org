* Motivation

- We have used =char= values and arrays but not strings.

- We cover string constants (aka literals) and variables:
  1) Rules for string literals
  2) Declaring string variables
  3) Reading and writing strings
  4) Writing functions that process strings
  5) Understanding string-handling functions in the C library
  6) Setting up pointer arrays to strings of different length

- Focus on examples with short explanations

- Review questions

- Exercises

- Programming assignments

* Escape Sequences in String Literals

- *Definition.* A /string literal/ is a sequence of characters enclosed
  within double quotes

- *Example:* Formatting strings in =printf= or =scanf= statement
  #+begin_src C
    printf("hello\n"); // without format specifier & escape sequence `\n`
    printf("%d is smaller than %g\n", 100, 100.1); // with format specifier
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : hello
  : 100 is smaller than 100.1

- *Example* - different escape sequences:
  #+begin_src C
    printf("\"The world will never starve for want of wonders;\nbut only for want of wonder.\"\nG.K. Chesterton");
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : "The world will never starve for want of wonders;
  : but only for want of wonder."
  : G.K. Chesterton

* Continuing a String Literal

- *Example*: Continuing a string literal on the next line
  #+begin_src C
    printf("\"Man only likes to count his troubles; \
    he doesn't calculate his happiness.\" \
           \nFyodor Dostoyevsky, Notes from Underground.\n");
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : "Man only likes to count his troubles; he doesn't calculate his happiness."
  : Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Notes from Underground.

- A better way to join two string literals: When the compiler finds
  white space between string literals, it will join them.
  #+begin_src C
    printf("\"To know and love one other human being"
           " is the root of all wisdom.\"\n"
           "Evelyn Waugh, Brideshead Revisited");
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : "To know and love one other human being is the root of all wisdom."
  : Evelyn Waugh, Brideshead Revisited

* How String Literals are Stored

- C treats string literals as character arrays: When the compiler
  encounters a string literal of length =n=, it sets aside =n+1= bytes of
  memory for the string - the characters of the string plus the /null/
  character.

- The null character is a byte whose bits are all zero, so it's
  represented by the =\0= escape sequence.

- The empty string =""= is stored as a single null character.

- Example: When =printf("abc")= is called, it is passed the address of ="abc"=, a
  pointer to where the leetter =a= is stored in memory.

* Operations on String Literals

- We can use a string literal wherever C allows a =char *= pointer. The
  assignment below does not copy ="abc"=. It makes p point to the first
  character of the string:
  #+begin_src C
    char *p;
    p = "abc";
  #+end_src

- Pointers can be subscripted, and so can string literals.
  #+begin_src C
    char ch;
    ch = "abc"[1];
    printf("%c\n",ch);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : b

- In the example, =ch= is assigned the character 'b'. As a char it can
  only hold one character. If if were declared as a =char *= pointer, it
  would point to a character rather than store one.

- Other possible subscripts are 0 ('a'), 2 ('c'), and 3 (the null
  character). This is used in the following function:
  #+begin_src C
    // convert number in (0,15) to a character that represents a
    // hexadecimal digit
    char digit_to_hex_char(int digit)
    {
      return "0123456789ABCDEF"[digit];
    }

    int main(void)
    {
      int digit = 15;
      char hex = digit_to_hex_char(digit);
      printf("%d to %c\n", digit, hex);
      return 0;
    }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 15 to F

- What happens when you try to modify a string literal?
  #+begin_src C
    char *p = "abc"; // p points to 'a'

    printf("%c", p[1+1]);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : c

- This leads to a segmentation fault
#+begin_example C
    char *p = "abc"; // p points to 'a'
    *p = 'd'; // segmentation fault!
  #+end_example

* String Literals versus Character Constants

- A string literal containing a single character is not the same as a
  character constant.

- The string literal "a" is represented by a *pointer* to a memory
  location that contains the character 'a' followed by '\0':

  #+begin_src C :results non
    printf("\n"); // printf expects a pointer as its first argument
  #+end_src

- The character constant 'a' is represented by an *integer* (the
  numerical code for the character).

  #+begin_src C
    printf("%d",'\n'); // prints ASCII code for '\n'
    printf("\n%d",'\0'); // prints ASCII code for '\0'
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 10
  : 0

* Initializing String Variables

- C does not have a =string= type for declaring string variables.

- In C, any one-dimensional array of characters can be used to store a
  string, which is terminated by a /null/ character.

- To store a string of up to 80 characters, declare the variable to be
  an array of 81 characters:

  #+begin_src C
    #define STR_LEN 80
    char str[STR_LEN+1];
  #+end_src

- A string variable can be initialized when it's declared:

  #+begin_src C
    char date1[8] = "June 14"; // storing 7 characters in an 8 char array
    printf("%s\n", date1);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : June 14

- =date1= looks like this:
  #+attr_html: :width 600px:
  [[../img/date1.png]]

- ="June 14"= *is not a string literal*! It is an abbreviation for an
  array initializer. The following statement is equivalent:

  #+begin_src C
    char date1[8] = {'J', 'u', 'n', 'e', ' ', '1', '4', '\0'};
    printf("%s\n", date1);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : June 14

- If the initializer is too short to fill the string variable, the
  compiler adds extra null characters:

  #+begin_src C
    char date2[9]="June 14"; // storing 7 characters in a 9 char array
    printf("%s\n", date2);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : June 14

- =date2= looks like this:
  #+attr_html: :width 600px:
  [[../img/date2.png]]

- If the initializer is exactly as long as the string variable, the
  null character is omitted, and the array cannot be used as a string.

- In this example, you can not guarantee that the printout will work
  because =printf= expects the next character to be null but it may not
  #+begin_src C
    char date3[7]="June 14"; // storing 7 characters in a 7 char array
    printf("%s\n", date3);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : June 14

- =date3= looks like this:
  #+attr_html: :width 600px:
  [[../img/date3.png]]

- Here is a longer program to test this:
  #+begin_src C
    char date3[7] = "June 14"; // No null terminator
    char following_data[] = "Extra";

    // Print `date3` normally (this might print garbage after "June 14" due to lack of `\0`)
    printf("Output without null terminator: %s\n", date3);

    // Manually insert a `\0` in `following_data` to control the behavior
    following_data[0] = '\0';

    // Now print again to see if output changes
    printf("Output after inserting a null character nearby: %s\n", date3);

    // Use memory addresses to directly inspect contents
    for (int i = 0; i < 15; i++) {
      printf("Byte %d after date3: %c (0x%X)\n", i, *(date3 + i), *(unsigned char *)(date3 + i));
     }
  #+end_src

- If the initializer is longer than the string variable, we have
  undefined behavior just like with any array.

  #+begin_src C
    char date[6]="June 14"; // storing 7 characters in a 6 char array
    printf("%s\n", date);
    printf("%c\n", date[6]);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : June 1
  :  

- If the declaration omits the length, the compiler computes it:

  #+begin_src C
    char date4[] = "June 14";
    printf("%s\n", date4);
    printf("%zu\n", sizeof(date4)); // length of string = 7 + 1 = 8
    printf("%zu\n", sizeof(date4[0])); // length of 1 char = 1
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : June 14
  : 8
  : 1

* Exercises: Initializing String Variables
** Exercise 1: Basic Initialization

- Declare a character array called =greeting= with a length of 10 and
  initialize it with the string ="Hello"=. Use =printf= to print the
  string.

  #+begin_src C
    char greeting[10] = "Hello";
    printf("%s\n", greeting);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Hello

** Exercise 2: Exact Fit without Null Character

- Declare a character array =month= with a length of 5 and initialize it
  with the string ="June"=. Print the string and observe the result.

- Modify the code to add a =\0= at the end of =month= and print it again.

  #+begin_src C
    char month[5] = "June";
    printf("%s\n", month); // Modify here to add \0 if needed
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : June

** Exercise 3: Overfilled Array

- Declare a character array =day= with length 3 and try initializing it
  with the string ="Mon"=. Print the array using =printf=.

  #+begin_src C
    char day[3] = "Mon";
    printf("%s\n", day);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Mon

** Exercise 4: Using =sizeof= with Strings
- Declare =char name[] = "Student";=. Print the size of =name= using
  =sizeof= and compare it with the length of the string.
- What is the relationship between =sizeof(name)= and the number of
  characters in ="Student"=?

  #+begin_src C
    char name[] = "Student";
    printf("Size of name: %zu\n", sizeof(name));
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Size of name: 8

* Character Arrays versus Character Pointers

- Strings can be defined either as arrays or as pointers:

  #+begin_src C
    char date_a[] = "June 14";
    char *date_p  = "June 14";

    printf("%s\n", date_a); // printing array
    printf("%s\n", date_p); // printing pointer
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : June 14
  : June 14

- What are the differences?

  1) In the array version, the characters stored in =date_a= can be
     modified as elements of an array.

  2) In the pointer version, =date_p= points to a string literal, and
     cannot be modified.

  3) In the array version, =date_a= is an array name.

  4) In the pointer version, =date_p= is a variable that can be made to
     point to other strings during program execution.

- The declaration =char *p;= sets aside memory for a pointer variable,
  but not for a string. To do that, we must write:

  #+begin_src C :results none
    #define STR_LEN 7

    char str[STR_LEN+1]; // declare string for STR_LEN characters
    char *p; // declare pointer that points to a character

    p = str; // p now points at str[0]
  #+end_src

- With a string:

  #+begin_src C
    char str[8] = "June 14", *p;

    p = str; // p now points at str[0]

    printf("%c %c %s\n", p[0], *p, p);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : J J June 14

- Using an uninitialized pointer variable as a string is an error:

  #+begin_src C
    char *p; // pointer points nowhere in particular
    // p[0] = 'a'; // segmentation fault
  #+end_src

- Explanation:
  #+begin_quote
  Since =p= has not been initialized, we don't know where it is
  pointing, and using it to write characters into memory causes
  undefined behavior.
  #+end_quote

* Exercises: Character Arrays versus Character Pointers
** Exercise 1: String Array vs. Pointer Modification Attempt
- Declare =char message_a[] = "Welcome";= and =char *message_p =
  "Welcome";=.

- Try modifying the first character of each: =message_a[0] = 'w';= and
  =message_p[0] = 'w';=.

  #+begin_src C
    char message_a[] = "Welcome";
    char *message_p = "Welcome";
    message_a[0] = 'w'; // Should work
    // message_p[0] = 'w'; // Uncomment to observe behavior
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:

** Exercise 2: Changing the Pointer Target

- Initialize two character arrays =char date1[] = "June 14";= and =char
  date2[] = "July 15";=.

- Declare a character pointer =char *p= and make it point to
  =date1=. Print the string using =p=, then change =p= to point to =date2= and
  print again.

  #+begin_src C
    char date1[] = "June 14";
    char date2[] = "July 15";
    char *p = date1;
    printf("%s\n", p);
    p = date2;
    printf("%s\n", p);
  #+end_src

** Exercise 3: Pointer Initialization and Dereferencing

- Declare a character array =char city[] = "Paris";= and a character
  pointer =char *ptr=.

- Initialize =ptr= to point to =city= and print the first character of
  =city= by dereferencing =ptr= with =*ptr= and =ptr[0]=.

  #+begin_src C
    char city[] = "Paris";
    char *ptr = city;
    printf("First character: %c %c\n", *ptr, ptr[0]);
  #+end_src

** Exercise 4: Uninitialized Pointer Error Simulation

- Declare a character pointer =char *uninitialized_ptr;=. Attempt to
  assign =uninitialized_ptr[0] = 'X';=.

  #+begin_src C
    char *uninitialized_ptr;
    // uninitialized_ptr[0] = 'X'; // Uncomment to see runtime error
  #+end_src

* Writing Strings Using =printf= and =puts=

- Writing strings is easy with =printf= or =puts=

  #+begin_src C
    char str[]= "Are we having fun yet?";
    printf("%s\n",str);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Are we having fun yet?

- =printf= will continue to print until it finds a null character in
  memory.

- To print just part of a string on a field of size =m=, use the
  conversion spec =%m.ps= where =p= is the number of characters to be
  displayed.

  #+begin_src C
    char str[]= "Are we having fun yet?";

    // print part of string
    printf("%.6s\n", str);

    puts("|----|----|----|"); // `puts` always ends with an \n
    // print part of string on field of length 10 (right-aligned)
    printf("%10.6s\n", str);
    // print part of string on field of length 10 (left-aligned)
    printf("%-10.6s\n", str);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Are we
  : |----|----|----|
  :     Are we
  : Are we

* Exercises: Writing strings
** Exercise 5: Simple String Output

- *Problem*: Write a program that stores the string ="Learning C is
  fun!"= in a variable and prints it to the console.

- *Solution*:
  #+begin_src C
    char str[] = "Learning C is fun!";
    printf("%s\n", str);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Learning C is fun!

** Exercise 6: Partial String Output

- *Problem*: Modify the previous program to only print the first 10
  characters of the string.

- *Solution*:
  #+begin_src C
    char str[] = "Learning C is fun!";
    printf("%.10s\n", str);  // Prints "Learning C"
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Learning C

** Exercise 7: String Formatting with Field Width
- *Problem*: Use the string ="C programming"= and:
  1. Print only the first 5 characters in a field of width 8,
     right-aligned.
  2. Print only the first 5 characters in a field of width 8,
     left-aligned.
  3. Print a ruler (=|....|....|....|=) to check your results.

- *Solution*:
  #+begin_src C
    char str[] = "C programming";
    puts("|....|....|....|");
    printf("%8.5s\n", str);  // Right-aligned
    printf("%-8.5s\n", str); // Left-aligned
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : |....|....|....|
  :    C pro
  : C pro

** Exercise 8: Safe String Input with fgets

- *Problem*: Write a program that reads a line of text using =fgets= and
  then prints it. Use the =:cmdline < strinput= header argument to
  stream the data to the program.

- String input:
  #+begin_src bash :results output
    echo "To C or not to C that is the question" > strinput
    cat strinput
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : To C or not to C that is the question

- *Solution*:
  #+begin_src C :cmdline < strinput
    char buffer[80];  // Buffer to store input
    fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin);
    printf("You entered: %s", buffer);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : You entered: To C or not to C that is the question

* Reading strings using =scanf= and =gets=

- Reading a string is harder because input string and string variable
  must have the same length.

- To read, we can use =scanf= or =gets=, or read strings one character at
  a time.

- There's no need for an address-of operator =&= in front of =str= in the
  call, because it is treated like as a pointer when passed to a
  function, and it always stores a null character at the end of the
  string:

  #+begin_src C :cmdline < strinput
    char str[19];
    scanf("%s", str);
    printf("%s\n", str);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Are

- Input file
  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
    echo "Are we having fun?" > strinput
    cat strinput
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Are we having fun?

- Explanation: When =scanf= is called, it skips white space, then reads
  characters and stores them in =str= until it encounters white
  space. It cannot read a full line of input with white space.

- To do this, use =gets=: It does not skip whitespace at the start, and
  it reads until it finds a =\n= (newline) character - it discards it
  and replaces it by =\0=.

  #+begin_src C :cmdline < strinput
    char str[19];
    gets(str); // unsafe: use `fgets`
    printf("%s\n", str);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Are we having fun?

- Both =scanf= and =gets= are inherently /unsafe/ because they may store
  characters past the end of the array:

  1) =scanf= can be made safer with =%ns= where =n= is the maximum number of
     characters to be stored.

  2) =fgets= is a safe alternative to =gets=, but it requires us to
     understand file streams (check the Linux =man= page for info).

- Example:

  #+begin_src C :cmdline < strinput
    char str[19];  // Str to store the input

    fgets(str, sizeof(str), stdin);
    printf("%s", str);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Are we having fun?

* Reading strings character by character

- Regular subscripting:
  #+begin_src C
    char str[]="Are we having fun?";
    int i;

    for (i=0; i < 18; i++) // goes to N-1 to avoid printing \0
      printf("%c", str[i]);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Are we having fun?

- More elegant: use the knowledge about strings!
  #+begin_src C
    char str[]="Are we having fun?";
    int i;

    for (i=0; str[i] != '\0'; i++) // loop until first '\0'
      printf("%c", str[i]);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Are we having fun?

* Accessing the characters in a string (counting spaces)

- Write a function that counts the number of spaces in a string
  #+begin_src C :main no
    // count spaces in a string - return integer count value
    int count_spaces(const char s[])
    {
      int count=0, i; // counter and loop variables

      for (i=0; s[i] != '\0'; i++)
        if (s[i] == ' ')
          count++;
      return count;
    }

    int main(void)
    {
      char str[]="Are we having                fun?";

      // str decays to pointer to str[0] upon function call
      printf("Spaces in \"%s\" = %d\n", str, count_spaces(str));

      return 0;
    }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Spaces in "Are we having                fun?" = 18

- Using pointer arithmetic is especially convenient for strings:
  #+begin_src C
    int count_spaces(const char *s)
    {
      int count = 0;

      for( ; *s != '\0'; s++ )
        if (*s == '\0')
          count++;
      return count;
    }
    int main(void)
    {
      char str[]="Are we having fun?";

      // str decays to pointer to str[0] upon function call
      printf("Spaces in \"%s\" = %d\n", str, count_spaces(str));

      return 0;
    }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Spaces in "Are we having                fun?" = 0

* Using the C string library =<string.h>=

- Straight copying won't work!
  #+begin_example C
char str1[10], str2[10];

str1 = "abc"; // wrong: array cannot be an lvalue
str2 = str1; // wrong
#+end_example

- This will compile but with nonsense results:
  #+begin_example C
  if (str1 == str2) // wrong: no vectorization
#+end_example

- Get length with =strlen= 
- Copy with =strcpy= (safe: =strncpy=)
- Compare with =strcmp=
- Concatenate with =strcat= (safe: =strncat=)

* Example: =strcpy=

- Example prototype for =strcpy=
  #+begin_src C :results none
    // function: strcpy
    // returns a char pointer
    // copies string s2 into destination string s1
    // it does not change the source string s2
    char *strcpy(char *s1, const char *s2);
  #+end_src

- Quick example:
  #+begin_src C
    char str[80];
    printf("%s\n",str);

    strcpy(str,"Hello");

    printf("%s\n",str);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : @ .ÙV
  : Hello

* Command-line arguments

- Programs often need to be supplied with information from =stdin= - a
  file name, or a switch/flag/option that modifies the programs
  behavior:
  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
    ls -l [7]*
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : -rw-rw-r-- 1 marcus marcus  9079 Nov 14 10:39 7_strings_codealong_copy.org
  : -rw-rw-r-- 1 marcus marcus  6959 Nov 14 09:27 7_strings_codealong.org
  : -rw-rw-r-- 1 marcus marcus 24246 Nov 19 09:50 7_strings.org

  #+begin_src bash
    which ls
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : /usr/bin/ls

- In the example,
  1. =ls= is the C program (executable for file listing with PATH),
  2. =-l= is the flag (long listing), and
  3. =[7]*= is a regular expression (all files beginning with =7=).

- Command-line information is available to all files not just OS
  commands. To access these /command-line arguments/, we define =main= as
  a function not without (=void=) but with two parameters, =argc= and =argv=:

  #+begin_src C :results none
    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
      return 0;
    }
  #+end_src

- =argc= is the "argument count": The number of command-line arguments
  (including the name of the program itself.

- =argv= is the "argument vector": An array of pointers to the
  command-line arguments, stored in string form.

- =argv[0]= points to the name of the program, =argv[1]= to =argv[argc-1]=
  point to the remaining command-line arguments, while the last
  element, =argv[argc]= is always a null pointer that points nowhere.

- The preprocessor macro =NULL= represents a null pointer (cannot be
  dereferenced - has no value equivalent):
  #+begin_src C
    int *ptr = NULL; // NULL macro used to define a null pointer

    if (ptr == NULL) {
      printf("Pointer is null.\n");
     } else {
      printf("Pointer is not null.\n");
     }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Pointer is null.

- Example: If the user enters =gcc main.c -o main=, =argv= points to the
  following values:

  | Index | Value    | Explanation                                        |
  |-------+----------+----------------------------------------------------|
  |     0 | "gcc"    | The name of the program being executed (with path) |
  |     1 | "main.c" | The first argument, the input source file + \0     |
  |     2 | "-o"     | The option flag specifying output file name + \0   |
  |     3 | "main"   | The name of the output file + \0                   |
  |     4 | NULL     | Null pointer                                       |

- If the program name is not available, =argv[0]= points to an empty
  string.

- You can print the command-line arguments with array subscripting:
  
  #+begin_src C :tangle argv.c :results none :main no
    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
      int i;
      for(i=1;i<argc;i++)
        printf("%s ", argv[i]);
      puts("");
      return 0;
    }
  #+end_src

- To test this program, compile it and run it on any command-line
  input.

  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
    gcc argv.c -o CMD
    ./CMD foo bar baz
    ./CMD ls -l main.c
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : foo bar baz 
  : ls -l main.c 

- You can also print the command-line arguments with pointer arithmetic:
  
  #+begin_src C :main no :results no :tangle argv2.c
    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
      char **p; // p is a pointer to a pointer to a character

      // start: p points to argv[1] which points to the first string after
      // the program name
      // stop: when the pointer is the NULL pointer
      // increment: go to next pointer (element of argv)
      for (p = &argv[1]; *p != NULL; p++) 
        printf("%s ", *p); // print dereferenced pointer = stored string
      puts("");
      return 0;
    }
  #+end_src

- Testing:  

  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
    gcc argv2.c -o CMD
    ./CMD foo bar baz
    ./CMD ls -l main.c
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : foo bar baz 
  : ls -l main.c 

- Why would you not just use =main(void)=?
  #+begin_quote
  You might want to use =main= like a function, and not just like a
  program block.
  #+end_quote  

- Using =main= with the full parameter list also simplifies code
  testing. Check e.g. this program to sum two numbers.
  
  1) Check if the number of arguments is correct & print usage.
  2) Convert command-line arguments to integers.
  3) Print the integers and their sum.
     
  #+begin_src C :tangle sum.c :results none
    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
      if (argc != 3) { // argv[0] points to the executable, argv[1],
    		   // argv[2] point to the two numbers to be added
        printf("Usage: %s <num1> <num2>\n", argv[0]); // name of program
        return 1;
      }
      // convert command-line arguments to integers
      int num1 = atoi(argv[1]);
      int num2 = atoi(argv[2]);      

      // print the sum of the two numbers
      printf("The sum of %d and %d is %d\n", num1, num2, num1 + num2);
      return 0;
    }
  #+end_src

  Test: When the command fails, you now get a return code 1 and usage
  information.
  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
    gcc sum.c -o sum
    ./sum 10 20 # this works 
    echo 10 20 | ./sum  # this does not work
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : The sum of 10 and 20 is 30
  : Usage: ./sum <num1> <num2>
