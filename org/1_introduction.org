* Overview

This is an introductory "theoretical" chapter with a little code but
from a bunch of different languages because data structures are
important everywhere.

*Objectives:*
- Understand the importance of data structures
- See some examples of data structures
- Understand the relationship between algorithms and data structures
- Discuss an extended sample use case ("Pet Emergency Room")

* Data structures are everywhere

Why?
#+begin_quote
- Data are everywhere.
- Data need to be stored (permanently).
- Data need to be processed (moved around, added and deleted)
- Data need to be found (fast).
#+end_quote

* Which data structures do you already know from introductory programming?

That is, if you think about data (numbers, names, characters, etc.)
how would you store them?

Examples:
#+begin_quote
1) Arrays like ~a[] = {1,2,3,4}~ in C/C++
2) Lists like ~foo = [1,2,3,4]~ in Python
3) Vectors like ~c(1,2,3,4} -> foo~ in R
4) Matrices like ~M <- diag(4)~ in R
5) Dictionaries like ~d = {"key":[1,2,3,4]}~ in Python
6) Structures like ~struct Person { std::string name; int age;}~ in C++
7) Enumeration like ~enum Color { RED, GREEN, BLUE }~ in C++
8) Data frames like ~df = pd.DataFrame([1,2],["a","b"])~ in Python
9) Class like ~public class Person~ in Java
10) Table like ~CREATE TABLE t (int ID, name TEXT);~ in SQL
#+end_quote

What about media like videos, images, graphs etc.? Are these data, and
how are they stored?
#+begin_quote
Also as arrays, lists or dictionaries (key-value pairs) in code and for storage:
- Images: as files in different formats (PNG, JPG, GIF, etc.), or as
  pixel matrices for programming and analytics purposes.
- Videos: as sequences of images (frames) with audio data, in
  different file formats (MP4, MOV, AVI, etc.)
- Graphs: collections of nodes and edges. 
#+end_quote

* Data structures are necessary

Data structures are necessary because of the large of information to
be organized and searched through in the digital world.

1) When you open a file, you use a *file system data structure*. Files
   are stored in structures containing millions of blocks of memory.

2) When you look up a contact on your phone, your phone uses partial
   information to narrow down the *search* (and it's not powerful) using
   a data structure (like a dictionary).

3) When you log into a social network, the network servers *check* your
   login information among possibly billions of users.

4) When you do a web *search*, the search engine uses data structures to
   find the web pages containing your search terms: among (as of 2024)
   an estimated 50 billion index by Google alone.

5) When you dial 911, the emergency services network looks up your
   phone number in a data structure that maps phone numbers to
   addresses so that someone can go to you right away.

* Which data structures are used when searching for an address on Google Maps?

Every one of these examples employs not one but half a dozen different
data structures. E.g. An address search on Google Maps uses the
following data structures:

1. *Geospatial Indexing*
   - *Quadtree*: A tree data structure in which each internal node has
     exactly four children. Quadtrees are used to partition a
     two-dimensional space by recursively subdividing it into four
     quadrants or regions. This is useful for indexing geographical
     locations efficiently.
   - *R-tree*: A tree data structure used for spatial access methods,
     i.e., for indexing multi-dimensional information. It is commonly
     used for indexing spatial information such as geographical
     coordinates, which is crucial for efficiently querying map data.

2. *Hash Maps and Tries*
   - *Hash Map*: This data structure is used for quick lookups of
     specific addresses or place names. It allows for constant time
     complexity for search operations, which is important for
     performance in real-time applications.
   - *Trie (Prefix Tree)*: A specialized tree used to store associative
     data structures. A trie is often used for autocomplete features
     in search queries, allowing for quick lookup of address prefixes
     and suggestions.

3. *Graph Structures*
   - *Graph*: Google Maps uses graph data structures to represent the
     network of roads, intersections, and various routes. Each node in
     the graph represents a geographic location (like an
     intersection), and each edge represents a road segment connecting
     two nodes. This is essential for route planning and navigation.

4. *KD-Trees*
   - *KD-Tree (k-dimensional tree)*: A space-partitioning data structure
     for organizing points in a k-dimensional space. KD-trees are
     useful for nearest neighbor searches, which are common in mapping
     applications when finding the closest location or point of
     interest.

5. *Spatial Databases*
   - *Spatial Database*: Specialized databases designed to store and
     query data related to objects in space, including points, lines,
     and polygons. Google Maps relies on spatial databases to manage
     large-scale geographic data efficiently.

* Algorithms vs. Data Structures

- An *algorithm* is a set of well-defined instructions, a step-by-step
  procedure to solve a problem (e.g. compute 1 + 1) or perform a task
  (e.g. say 'hello world').

- Algorithms can be described using pseudocode (syntax-free
  code)[fn:1]. Here are three examples for a "fizzbuzz" function:
  #+attr_html: :width 600px:
  #+caption: Source: Wikipedia
  [[../img/pseudocodeExamples.png]]

- A *data structure* is a way of organizing and storing data in a
  computer via a programming language. It defines the relationship
  between the elements of the structure, the operations that can be
  performed on the data, and the rules or constraints for accessing
  and modifying the data.

- Short formula: *Algorithms transform data like verbs acting on nouns.*
  #+attr_html: :width 600px:
  #+caption: Source: La Rocca, Grokking Data Structures (Manning, 2024)
  [[../img/01__image003.png]]

- Some data structures are designed to allow efficient execution of
  certain algorithms, e.g. *hash tables* for key-based search.

- You automatically learn about algorithms when studying data
  structures and vice versa ([[https://catalog.lyon.edu/computer-science/csc-240][CSC 240]] and [[https://catalog.lyon.edu/computer-science/csc-265][CSC 265]]).

* Data structures matter

- Different data structures have wildly differing properties and
  powers - compare for example *arrays* and *vectors* in C++.

- *C++ array vs. vector:*
  1) *Arrays* are collection of elements of the same type, stored in
     contiguous memory locations. They are used to store multiple
     values in one variable. Values can be accessed using an
     index. The size of the array is determined at compile-time.
  2) *Vectors* are dynamic arrays provided by the C++ Standard Template
     Library (STL). They can grow and shrink in size dynamically as
     elements are added or removed, that is at run-time. They offer
     useful member functions.

- *Array* code example: declare and initialize an array using a =for= loop.
  #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both
    // declare array of 5 integers and initialize it to 0
    int array[5]{};

    // assign values to the array using a traditional for loop
    for (int index=0; index < 5; index++) {
      array[index] = index + 100;
     }

    // print initialized array using a range-based for loop
    for (int value : array) cout << value << " ";
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 100 101 102 103 104 

 - *Vector* code example:
  #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both
    #include <vector>

    int main() {
      // create integer vector
      vector<int> myVector;

      // Adding elements to the vector
      for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        myVector.push_back(i + 100);
      }

      // Accessing and printing elements
      for (int i = 0; i < myVector.size(); ++i) {
        cout << myVector[i] << " ";
      }

      return 0;
    }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 100 101 102 103 104

- If C++ is not (yet) your mojo, think of the difference between
  *lists*, *tuples*, and *dictionaries* in Python:
  1) *list* elements can be of any data type, but *tuple* elements must
     have the same data type.
  2) *list* elements are ordered (indexed), but *dictionaries* are unordered.
  3) *lists* are mutable (can be modified), but *tuples* are immutable.
  4) *lists* are passed by reference, but *tuples* are passed by value.

- Code examples:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :results output
    # list elements can have any data type
    foo = [1, "Hello", 'A', True]
    # lists are ordered
    print(foo[0], foo[1], foo[2], foo[3])
    # lists are mutable
    foo[2] = 'B'
    print(foo)
    # lists are passed by reference (not by value)
    bar = foo; bar[1]=2; print(foo) # change value in bar - copied to foo
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 1 Hello A True
  : [1, 'Hello', 'B', True]
  : [1, 2, 'B', True]

- R is another interesting example: the central data structure is the
  vector; defining and manipulating vectors is made very simple, and
  as an added plus, R indices start from 1 instead of 0:
  #+begin_src R :session *R* :results output :exports both
    foo <- c(1,3,-100,42)  # defining a vector
    foo  # printing vector
    bar <- c(foo, foo)  # extending the vector
    foo / 2 # vectorization: element-wise operations and implicit conversion
    matrix(1:16,4) # a 4 x 4 matrix. Full command: matrix(data=1:16,nrow=4)
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : [1]    1    3 -100   42
  : [1]   0.5   1.5 -50.0  21.0
  :      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
  : [1,]    1    5    9   13
  : [2,]    2    6   10   14
  : [3,]    3    7   11   15
  : [4,]    4    8   12   16

  
- Unlike C/C++ and Python, a lot of visualization options are already
  built into R.

- Graphics depend on data structures, too! Compare e.g. the SVG
  (Scalable Vector Graphics) image format whose images are represented
  not as a grid of pixels but using geometric shapes (points, lines,
  curves, polygons). Advantage: images are scalable to any size
  without loss of quality.

* Why you should learn data structures

- Learn an essential tool you cannot really do without (like editing,
  managing files or plotting data).
- Progress in Machine learning depends on new data structures like
  graph neural nets.
- The database landscape is evolving as data volumes grow
  (e.g. flexible indexing)
- Avoid Maslow's hammer ("If your toolbelt only has a hammer, you will
  be tempted to treat everything as a nail.") - What if you must
  tighten a screw? The answer is abstraction (but not too much).
- Abstraction is great (C), too much abstraction makes things harder
  than they need to be at the start (C++).

* NEXT Example use cases

1) Searching through a large collection of baseball cards (binary
   search on sorted arrays)
   
2) Keeping track of logged-in users and their IP addresses (at scale,
   and securely - hash tables).
   
3) Modeling relationships between social media network users
   (persistent and scalable - graphs).

4) In game development, AI calculations are optimized, such as
   determining the best move (storing previous calculations -
   memoization).

5) Text processing - auto-completion and spell checking (store dynamic
   sets of strings - trie memoization).

6) Task scheduling with priority queues (sorting, traversing - heaps).
* How do choose the right data structure

By building up algorithmic muscle: solve *many problems* in *different
ways* and with *different data structures*:

Example: "Hello" program that greets the user by name
1) Input from the keyboard or from a file
2) Output to the screen or to a file
3) Output with =cout= (=iostream) or =printf= (=stdio.h=)
4) User name stored as =string= or as =char= array
5) User name retrieved with =cin= or with =cin.get= or =scanf=
6) Concatenate greeting message with =+= or stream with =<<=
7) With a user-defined function or as standalone command
8) With a user-defined =class= or =struct=
9) Print from =main= program or from a subroutine
10) Fix length of string or use variable-length arrays.

These solutions differ by performance, flexibility, readability,
nstandardization, style, and portability.

* A mental model for applying data structures
#+attr_html: :width 700px:
#+caption: BPMN model for using data structures
[[../img/identify_data_structure.png]]

- The implementation comes after everything else.
- The days of finding solutions through "tinkering" are over.
- Computer programs can be formally proven to be correct[fn:2].

* Extended use case: "Pet emergency room"

- *Problem:* how to run an emergency waiting room for pets, in
  particular the registration and admission of patients.

- *Constraints:*
  + multiple species of animals
  + infinite capacity of the waiting room
  + no other constraints

- *Input:* time-ordered group of animals.

- *Output:* ordered waiting list.

- *Process:* register animals, then admit them in order.

There are (at least) four different solutions to choose from:

* Bag

- Data structure: *Bag*. All patient forms are put in the container in
  random order.

- *Check:* Does solution work, and does it work well?
  1) A bag is easy to implement.
  2) You cannot keep control over the order.

* Stack

- Data structure: *Stack*. All patient forms are stored in order, in a
  pile with the oldest at the top and the newest at the bottom. Forms
  are taken from the top.

- Does solution work, and does it work well?
  1) A stack is good to process the most recent entries first.
  2) It's bad to handle a waiting line (prioritizes recent entries).

* Queue

- Data structure: : *Queue.* All patient forms are stored in order, in a
  pile with the oldest at the bottom and the newest at the top. Forms
  are taken from the bottom.

- Does solution work, and does it work well?
  1) The queue implements a first come, first serve policy.
  2) Problem: urgent entries are forced to wait.

* Priority queue

- Data structure: *Priority queue*. A queue that takes more than
  arrival time into account. It also contains information on
  *priority*. Patient forms are ordered first by priority, and then by
  arrival.

- Does solution work, and does it work well?
  1) Urgent entries are now processed first.
  2) This container is slower and more complex to implement.

* Model each process in BPMN

- BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) is a diagrammatic language
to create process models that represent the flow of an action from
start to end for every participant of a process.

- In this case, the participant is the Pet ER Receptionist who
  interacts with the patients by getting forms from the patient, sorts
  the forms, and pulls them from the stack before calling upon the
  next patient.

- "Priority queue" solution  
  #+attr_html: :width 600px:
  #+caption: BPMN models for "Pet Emergency Room" use case: Priority Queue
  [[../img/priority_queue.png]]

- You can see that the procedural shape of these processes is much the
  same.

* Abstract Data Types
  
- Mastering the chosen data structure involves mastering a set of
  operations, actions to perform with them. 

- A data structure together with basic operations like /insert/, /remove/,
  /traverse/, /count/ etc. is called an Abstract Data Type (ADT).

- The set of operations of an ADT constitute its /public interface/. It
  defines what we're allowed to do with it.

- Example: inserting an element into a linked list requires creating
  and deleting pointers between link elements.

* The need for efficiency ([[https://opendatastructures.org/ods-cpp/1_1_Need_Efficiency.html][Morin]])

- *Example:* If an application looks up a dataset with 1 mio (10^{6})
  items, and if each item needs to be looked up at least once, we have
  10^{12} = 10^6 x 10^6 searches or number of operations.

- If a processor can perform 1 bio (10^{9}) operations per second, it
  will take it 10^{12}/10^{9} = 1000 seconds or 16 min 40 sec to search
  through the dataset once.

- Google indexes over 50 bio (50 x 10^9) web pages, which means that a
  query over this data would take no less than 50 seconds. Google
  received approximately 40,000 = 4 x 10^{5} queries per second. Google
  operates no less than 40 data centers with no less than 50,000
  servers per data center (40 x 5 x 10^5 = 2 x 10^{7}) - to match this
  demand.

- The examples show that obvious implementations of data structures do
  not scale well if the number of items n in the data structure
  (e.g. a table) and the number of operations m performed on it
  (e.g. a search) are large because the time (measured in machine
  instructions) is roughly n x m.

- For example there are data structures where a search only needs to
  look at two items on average independent on the number of items
  stored - which means that a 1 bio instructions per second computer
  can complete a search of 50 bio pages in 2 x 10-9 seconds, or 2 nano
  seconds.

- Then there are data structures where the number of items inspected
  during an operation grows very slowly as a function of the number of
  items.

* Summary

- A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a
  computer or a programming language, defining the relationship
  between data, operations that can be performed on the data, and
  rules or constraints for accessing and modifying the data.
- Data structures are fundamental to organizing and storing data
  efficiently.
- An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions, a step-by-step
  procedure designed to solve a specific problem or perform a
  particular task.
- Algorithms and data structures complement each other like nouns and
  verbs complement each other in a sentence.
- Choosing the wrong data structure can have dire consequences, such
  as crashing your website or causing security hazards.
- There is a step-by-step process that can help you decide which data
  structures to use in a project.
- The process is iterative and requires you to check the quality of
  your solution until you meet all of your requirements.
- Abstract Data Types are Data Structures with their operations,
  e.g. a list with insertion, removing, counting, traversing.
