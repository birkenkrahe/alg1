* Entry test: write 10 simple programs (in C)

1. Declare two variables of type =int=, initialize them to appropriate
   values, and print them next to one another separated by a comma.

   Solution:
   #+begin_src C :main yes :includes <stdio.h> :results output :exports both :comments both

   #+end_src

2. Declare three integer variables: ~sum~, ~a~, ~b~. Initialize ~sum~
   to 0. Initialize the variables ~a~ and ~b~ to an appropriate integer
   value, use an assignment statement to assign ~sum~ the result of ~a~
   plus ~b~, and print the result: ~"The sum of _ and _ is _."~ using
   =printf=.

   Solution:
   #+begin_src C :main yes :includes <stdio.h> :results output :exports both :comments both

   #+end_src

3. Create a program in which 3 variables are declared. Create one
   float named =myFloat=, one int named =myInt=, and one =double= named
   =myDouble=. Initialize them to =3.14=, =3=, and =3.14159=,
   respectively. Print each variable on a line of its own like this:
   #+begin_example
     myFloat  = 3.14
     myInt    = 3
     myDouble = 3.14159
   #+end_example

   Solution:
   #+begin_src C :main yes :includes <stdio.h> :results output :exports both :comments both

   #+end_src

4. Create a program that displays the diameter and area of a circle
   for any given radius. Initialize the radius in the program. Use a
   =const float= to represent the literal π. The output should look like
   this: ~The area of a circle of diameter 2 is 3.14159~ (for r=1).

   Solution:
   #+begin_src C :main yes :includes <stdio.h> :results output :exports both :comments both

   #+end_src

5. Comment each line of this code (use the code block below):
   #+begin_example C
     #include <stdio.h>

     int main(void)
     {
       int time;
       printf("Enter time in seconds:\n");
       scanf("%d",&time);
       printf("You entered: %d seconds",time);
       int answer = (32 * time * time) / 2;
       printf("\nThe distance is %d feet.\n", answer);
       return 0;
     }
   #+end_example 

   *Background:* In the imperial metric system, 32 feet per second
   squared (or 9.8 meter per second squared in the metric system) is
   the approximate acceleration due to Earth's gravity for a freely
   falling body (no air friction or other effects assumed).

   Solution: To run this code, run the shell code block below first.
   #+begin_src C++ :cmdline < input :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     #include <stdio.h>

     int main(void)
     {
       int time;
       printf("Enter time in seconds:\n");
       scanf("%d",&time);
       printf("You entered: %d seconds",time);
       int answer = (32 * time * time) / 2;
       printf("\nThe distance is %d feet.\n", answer);
       return 0;
     }
   #+end_src

   #+begin_src bash :results output
     echo "10" > input
     cat input
   #+end_src

6. Data Types and conversion

   Write a 3-line program that declares a variable named ~sampleSize~ and set it
   to 14.58093. Use a compound operator to increase its value by 12.495. Finally
   print the result converted to an integer using =int=. The output
   should be 27.

   Solution:
   #+begin_src C :main yes :includes <stdio.h> :results output :exports both

   #+end_src

7. Conditionals

   - Write a program that declares two integers =a= and =b= and
     initializes them with appropriate values. The program should
     print out one message that informs the user if =a= is smaller or
     bigger than =b=, or if they're the same.

     Solution:
     #+begin_src C :main yes :includes <stdio.h> :results output :exports both

     #+end_src

   - Rook's Guide to C++ contains this rather useless (though not wrong) flow
     chart ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/alg1/blob/main/img/if_else_bad.png][fig. 10.2, pg. 51]]). This chart can be improved a lot, see this BPMN
     model created at bpmn.io ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/alg1/blob/main/img/if_else_good.svg][link]]).

8. Loops

   Do the first program, if you've completed section 7, and do the second
   program, if not.

   1) Wrap the program ='compare and b'= from sect. 7 ("Conditionals")
      in an /infinite/ loop, and ask the user after each iteration if he
      wants to quit or continue playing, exit the program accordinly,
      and print the number of iterations. Play at least once.

      Solution:
      #+begin_src C :cmdline < compare :tangle src/compare.c :main yes :includes <stdio.h> :results output :exports both

      #+end_src

      Testing with sample data:
      #+begin_src bash :results output
        echo "100 100 N
             -100 100 N
                8   1 Y" > compare
        cat compare
      #+end_src

   2) Create a =for= loop that outputs your =name= to the screen 10 times before
      exiting the loop.

      Solution I:
      #+begin_src C :main yes :includes <stdio.h> :results output :exports both
        for (int i=0; i<10; i++) {
          printf("Marcus ");
         }
      #+end_src

9. Arrays

   Create a program in which an integer array named ~myArray~ is declared with a
   size of 10. Use a =for= loop to prompt the user to store a value in every index
   of the array. Aer the array is given values, output the values of the array
   to the screen using a =for= loop. Output each value of the array on its own
   line.

   Input: 10 integers
   #+begin_src bash :results output
     echo "4 56 7 324 -4 0 21 -999 9 1" > array
     cat array
     cat array | wc -w
   #+end_src

   Solution:
   #+begin_src C :cmdline < data/array :main yes :includes <stdio.h> :results output
     
   #+end_src

10. Functions

    Write code that prompts the user for a number of miles travelled
    and a number of hours, then calculates the user's speed in miles
    per hour using a user-defined function named ~mph~.

    If you're doing this in Emacs, use the complete C program header
    and call ~mph~ in a =main= function:
    #+begin_example C
      #include <stdio.h>

      int main() {
          //....
      }
    #+end_example

    Solution:
    #+begin_src C :cmdline < mph :main no :includes <stdio.h> :results output 

    #+end_src

    Testing:
    #+begin_src bash :results output
      echo "740 11.5" > data/mph
      cat data/mph
    #+end_src
