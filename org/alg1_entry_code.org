* Entry test: Write 10 simple C++  programs

1. Declare two variables of type =int=, initialize them to appropriate
   values, and print them next to one another separated by a comma
   using the =cout= command and the stream extraction operator =<<=.

2. Declare three integer variables: ~sum~, ~a~, ~b~. Initialize ~sum~
   to 0. Initialize the variables ~a~ and ~b~ to an appropriate integer
   value, use an assignment statement to assign ~sum~ the result of ~a~
   plus ~b~, and print the result: ~"The sum of _ and _ is _."~ using
   =printf=.
   
3. Create a program in which 3 variables are declared. Create one
   float named myFloat, one int named myInt, and one double named
   myDouble. Initialize them to 3.14, 3, and 3.14159,
   respectively. Print each variable on a line of its own like this:
   #+begin_example
     myFloat  = 3.14
     myInt    = 3
     myDouble = 3.14159
   #+end_example

4. Create a program that displays the diameter and area of a circle
   for any given radius. Initialize the radius in the program. Use a
   =const float= to represent the literal π. The output should look like
   this: ~The area of a circle of diameter 2 is 3.14159~ (for r=1).

5. Comment each line of this code:
   #+begin_src C++ :cmdline < data/input :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     #include <iostream>
     using namespace std;

     int main()
     {
       int time;
       cout << "Enter time in seconds:\n";
       cin >> time;
       cout << "You entered: " << time << " seconds." << endl;
       int answer = (32 * time * time) / 2;
       cout << "The distance is ";
       cout << answer;
       cout << " feet.\n";
       return 0;
     }
   #+end_src

   *Background:* In the imperial metric system, 32 feet per second
   squared (or 9.8 meter per second squared in the metric system) is
   the approximate acceleration due to Earth's gravity for a freely
   falling body (no air friction or other effects assumed).

6. Data Types and conversion

   Write a 3-line program that declares a variable named ~sampleSize~ and set it
   to 14.58093. Use a compound operator to increase its value by 12.495. Finally
   print the result converted to an integer using =cout= and =int=. The output
   should be 27.

7. Conditionals

   - Write a program that declares two integers a and b and initializes them
     with appropriate values. The program should print out one message that
     informs the user if a is smaller or bigger than b, or if they're the same.

   - Rook's Guide to C++ contains this rather useless (though not wrong) flow
     chart ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/alg1/blob/main/img/if_else_bad.png][fig. 10.2, pg. 51]]). This chart can be improved a lot, see this BPMN
     model created at bpmn.io ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/alg1/blob/main/img/if_else_good.svg][link]]).

8. Loops

   Do the first program, if you've completed section 7, and do the second
   program, if not.

   1) Wrap the program [[compare a and b]] from sect. 7 ("Conditionals") in an
      infinite loop, and ask the user after each iteration if he wants to quit
      or continue playing, exit the program accordinly, and print the number of
      iterations. Play at least once.

   2) Create a =for= loop that outputs your =name= to the screen 10 times before
      exiting the loop.

9. Arrays

   Create a program in which an integer array named ~myArray~ is declared with a
   size of 10. Use a =for= loop to prompt the user to store a value in every index
   of the array. Aer the array is given values, output the values of the array
   to the screen using a =for= loop. Output each value of the array on its own
   line.

10. Functions

    Write code that prompts the user for a number of miles travelled
    and a number of hours, then calculates the user's speed in miles
    per hour using a user-defined function named ~mph~.
