* README

- These are worked out "review questions" for the first 100 pages
  (chapters 1-17) of the freely available Rook's Guide to C++
  (Hansen, 2013) - [[https://rooksguide.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rooks-guide-isbn-version.pdf][PDF Online]] (License: [[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/legalcode][CC-BY-NC-SA 3.0 Unported]]).

- I modified some of the exercises to make them either more
  interesting, or because they had mistakes in them.

- I believe that Rook's Guide to C++ is probably the shortest, and
  most pleasant introduction and/or recap for C++ (up to and including
  C++11). For more experienced programmers, I recommend Lospinoso's
  "C++ Crash Course" (NoStarch, 2019) - at almost 800 pages, it's way
  more complete (and it's being updated in 2024 for the 2nd
  edition). More complete, but also a lot more tedious is the book by
  Malik (2016) that has 1600 pages (but also includes data
  structures).

* Chapter 1: History

- Developed by Bjarne Stroustrup as "C with Classes" in 1980s
- Named C++ in 1989, standardized in 1998, overhauled every 3 years
- This book favors techniques from before the C++11 standard of 2011

* Chapter 2: Variables

- Overview of data types:
  #+name: table_2.1
  | Name   | Definition                                                            |
  |--------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | =int=    | Short for integer; stores whole numbers                               |
  | =char=   | Short for character; stores a single letter, digit, or symbol         |
  | =bool=   | Short for Boolean; stores =true= or =false=                               |
  | =float=  | Short for floating point number; stores numbers with fractional parts |
  | =double= | Short for double precision floating point number;                     |
  |        | stores bigger numbers with bigger fractional parts than =float=         |

- How do you decide which data type you need?
  #+begin_quote
  What you can do with a variable depends on the type of data it
  contains: you cannot store 100,000 in a =char= but in an =int= etc.
  #+end_quote

- Which data type is right for these data?
  1. 100,000,000
  2. 'A'
  3. "Hello world"
  4. 0
  5. 1
  6. 3.14
  7. 3.141592653589793

- Answers:
  #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> <string> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
    // declarations and definitions
    int i = 100000000;
    char a = 'A';
    string hw = "Hello world";
    bool False = 0, True = 1;
    float pi = 3.14;
    double Pi = 3.141592653589793;
    // output
    cout << "Integer i = " << i << endl
    << "Character a = " << a << endl
    << "String hw = " << hw << endl
    << "Boolean False = " << False << endl
    << "Boolean True = " << True << endl
    << "Float pi = " << pi << endl
    << "Double Pi = " << Pi << endl;
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Integer i = 100000000
  : Character a = A
  : String hw = Hello world
  : Boolean False = 0
  : Boolean True = 1
  : Float pi = 3.14
  : Double Pi = 3.14159

- *Identifiers* are the names of (typed) variables. Several identifiers
  of the same type can be declared together.

- Variables can be *initialized* with =cin= (read from standard input
  device) or via assignment with ===.

- You can mix assignment, declaration and evaluation:
  #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
    int a = 1, b = 2;
    int x = a + b, y = x;
    cout << a << " " << b << " " << x << " " << y << endl;
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 1 2 3 3

** Review questions (Variables)

1. Declare two variables of type int and initialize them to an
   appropriate value.
   #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     int foo = 100, bar = 200;
     cout << foo << endl << bar << endl;
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 100
   : 200

2. Declare three integer variables: sum, a, b. Initialize the
   variables a and b to integer values 1000 and 2000 and use an
   assignment statement to assign sum the result of a plus b. Print
   the result in this format:
   #+begin_example
     1000 + 2000 = 3000
   #+end_example

   Solution:
   #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     int sum, a = 1000, b = 2000; // declaration and initialization
     sum = a + b; // assignment
     cout << a << " + " << b << " = " << sum << endl; // print result
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 1000 + 2000 = 3000

3. Declare a double variable called number and initialize it to 13.6.
   #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     double number = 13.6; // declare and initialize
     cout << number << endl; // print
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 13.6

4. Create a program in which 3 variables are declared. Create one
   float named myFloat, one int named myInt, and one double named
   myDouble. Initialize them to 3.14, 3, and 3.14159,
   respectively. Print each variable on a line of its own like this:
   #+begin_example
     myFloat  = 3.14
     myInt    = 3
     myDouble = 3.14159
   #+end_example

   Solution:
   #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     // declare and initialize
     float myFloat = 3.14;
     int myInt = 3;
     double myDouble = 3.14159;
     // print result
     cout << "myFloat  = " << myFloat  << endl
     << "myInt    = " << myInt    << endl
     << "myDouble = " << myDouble << endl;
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : myFloat  = 3.14
   : myInt    = 3
   : myDouble = 3.14159

** Initializing variables with parentheses or braces

In C++, the parentheses ~()~ and curly braces ~{}~ are used for
different types of initialization, and they have some important
differences:

*** Parentheses ~()~
1. **Direct Initialization*:
   - When using parentheses, it is called direct initialization.
   - Example: ~int x(7);~ directly initializes ~x~ with the value ~7~.
   - Used for both fundamental types and class types.

2. **Function-style Casting**
   - Parentheses are also used for type casting in function-style casting.
   - Example: ~int x = int(7.5);~ casts ~7.5~ to an integer, resulting in ~x~ being ~7~.

3. **Ambiguity with Aggregate Initialization**
   - Parentheses cannot be used for initializing aggregate types (like
     =arrays= or =structs=) because they can be ambiguous.
   - Example: ~std::vector<int> v(5);~ initializes a ~std::vector~ with 5
     elements, but ~std::vector<int> v{5};~ initializes a ~std::vector~
     with one element having value ~5~.

*** Curly Braces ~{}~

1. **Uniform Initialization (Brace-enclosed Initialization)**
   - Introduced in C++11 to provide a more consistent and safer way of
     initializing variables.
   - Example: ~int x{7};~ or ~int x = {7};~ initializes ~x~ with the value
     ~7~.

2. **Initialization Lists**
   - Used for initializing containers and arrays.
   - Example: ~int arr[3] = {1, 2, 3};~ initializes an array with three
     elements.

3. **Avoids Narrowing Conversions**
   - Brace initialization prevents narrowing conversions, which can
     lead to data loss.
   - Example: ~int x{7.5};~ will cause a compile-time error, as ~7.5~
     cannot be safely converted to ~int~ without data loss.
   - In contrast, ~int x = 7.5;~ or ~int x(7.5);~ will compile but result
     in ~x~ being ~7~.

4. **Supports Aggregate Initialization**
   - Suitable for aggregate types (arrays, structs, etc.).
   - Example: ~struct Point { int x, y; }; Point p{1, 2};~ initializes ~Point~ with ~x=1~ and ~y=2~.

*** Summary of Differences

- **Syntax**: ~()~ for direct initialization, ~[]~ for uniform
  initialization.

- **Safety**: ~{}~ prevents narrowing conversions, ~()~ does not.

- **Use Cases**: ~()~ for fundamental types and function-style casting, ~{}~
  for consistent initialization, aggregates, and containers.

- **Aggregate Initialization**: ~{}~ is used for aggregates; ~()~ is not
  allowed.

By understanding these differences, you can choose the appropriate
initialization method for different contexts in your C++ programs.

* Chapter 3: Literals

- A *literal* is a constant that cannot be changed and that is
  not stored in a variable. This includes numbers like =3.14=,
  characters like =H=, strings like ="hello"=, or Booleans like ="hello"=.
- A *constant* is an unchanging value stored in a constant that we
  define ourselves, like ~pi~ in the following code chunk:
  #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
    const float pi = 3.14;
    float radius = 5, area;
    area = radius * radius * pi;
    cout << area;
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 78.5

** Review questions:

1. Describe the difference between literals and declared
   constants. When would a declared constant be more useful than a
   literal constant?
   #+begin_quote
   - Literals are built-in, while declared constants have to be declared
     at the start of the program and are removed from memory when they
     program execution has ended. A declared constant would be more
     useful if we want to change it ever.
   #+end_quote

2. What is the difference between a normal variable and a constant?
   #+begin_quote
   Literals cannot be changed or overwritten, normal variables can be
   changed.
   #+end_quote

3. Build a program in C++ that does the following:
   1) Declare a =double= variable named ~Feet~. Initialize it to your
      height.
   2) Declare a =double= constant named ~MetersPerFoot~, with the value of
      0.3048.
   3) Declare a =double= variable named ~Meters~. Set it to ~Feet~
      multiplied by ~MetersPerFoot~.

   #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     double Feet = 5.91;
     double feet = 5;
     double MetersPerFoot = 0.3048;
     double Meters = Feet * MetersPerFoot;
     cout << Feet << " feet = " << Meters << " m" << endl;
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 5.91 feet = 1.80137 m

4. Create a program that displays the diameter and area of a circle
   for any given radius. Use a =const float= to represent the literal π.
   #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     // const declaration
     const float pi = 3.141592;
     // variable declarations
     float area;
     // initialize variables
     float radius = 1.f; // radius = 1
     // compute area
     area = pi * radius * radius;
     // print results
     cout << "The area of a circle of diameter " << 2 * radius << " is " << area << endl;
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : The area of a circle of diameter 2 is 3.14159

* Chapter 4: Assignments

1. Which of the following is an *incorrect* way to assign a value to a
   variable ~x~ of type =int=? (Why?)

   - [X] ~7 = x;~
   - [ ] ~int x = 7;~
   - [ ] ~int x(7);~
   - [ ] ~x = 7;~

   #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     int x = 7;
     int y(7); // alternative assignment operator
     int z;
     z = y;
     cout << x << y << z << endl;
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 777

   Why?
   #+begin_quote
   - When a value is stored in a variable, the variable goes on the
     left of the assignment operator, and the value being stored in
     that variable goes to the right of the assignment operator.
   - In C++, ~int x(7);~ works because it uses direct initialization
     syntax to directly initialize the variable x with the
     value 7. This syntax is one of several ways to initialize
     variables in C++, and it is different from using the assignment
     operator.
   - ~int x = 7;~ is initialization by copy. Since C++11, you can also
     apply uniform or brace-enclosed initialization: ~int x{7};~
   #+end_quote

   Let's check this:
   #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     int x{10};
     cout << x << endl;
     int y(7.);
     cout << y << endl;
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 10
   : 7

2. Which of the following is an *incorrect* way to assign a value to a
   variable of type string, and why?
   - [ ] ~string myString = "word";~
   - [X] ~string myString = 'word';~
   - [ ] ~myString = "word";~

   #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     #include <string>
     string myString1 = "word";
     //string myString2 = 'word';
     string myString3;
     myString3 = "word";
     cout << myString1 << " " << myString3 << endl;
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : word word

3. Is the following code incorrect? If so, why? If it is correct, why?
   #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     int x = 6, y;
     char myChar = 'x';
     y = myChar + x;  // implicit conversion of myChar to equivalent ASCII number code 120x
     cout << y << endl;
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 126

   - [ ] Incorrect: You cannot add a character (myChar) and a number (x)
   - [X] Correct: myChar is implicitly converted to ASCII code (120)
     and added to x (6)
   - [ ] Incorrect: You cannot declare and define one (x) and declare
     another (y) integer on one line
   - [ ] Correct: x is converted to '6' and 'myChar' and '6' become
     'x6'.

4. Write a program that declares two =int= variables i, j and two =double=
   variables x, y.
   1) Assign the values 1,2, 3. and 4. to i,j,x,y, respectively.
   2) Add five to i and subtract 5 from j using compound operators.
   3) Multiply x with 7.32 and divice y by 7.32 using compound operators.
   4) Output your results to the screen.
   5) Comment your program throughout and check for readability.

   Expected output:
   #+begin_example
     i = -4
     j = 7
     x = 21.96
     y = 0.546448
   #+end_example

   Solution:
   #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     // declarations
     int i, j;
     double x, y;
     // initialization
     i = 1;
     j = 2;
     x = 3.;
     y = 4.;
     // computations
     i -= 5; // i = i - 5
     j += 5; // j = j + 5
     x *= 7.32; // x = x * 7.32
     y /= 7.32; // y = y / 7.32
     // output
     cout << "i = " << i << endl
     << "j = " << j << endl
     << "x = " << x << endl
     << "y = " << y << endl;
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : i = -4
   : j = 7
   : x = 21.96
   : y = 0.546448

* Chapter 5: Output

- =cout= stands for "console output". It is used in connection with the
  *stream insertion* operator =<<=.

** Review questions

1. Which of the following is a correct way to output ~"Hello World"~ to
   the screen?
   - [X] cout << "\"Hello World\"";
   - [ ] output: "Hello World";
   - [ ] cout >> "Hello World";
   - [ ] cout << "Hello World";
   - [ ] console.output << "Hello World";

   #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     cout << "\"Hello World\"";
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : "Hello World"

2. Which of the following is a correct way to output ~Hello!~ to the
   screen on one line and ~Goodbye!~ to the screen on the next line?

   - [ ] cout >> "Hello!" >> "Goodbye!";
   - [ ] output: "Hello!\nGoodbye!";
   - [ ] cout << "Hello!" << \n << "Goodbye!";
   - [X] cout << "Hello!" << '\n' << "Goodbye!";

   #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     cout << "Hello!" << '\n' << "Goodbye!";
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Hello!
   : Goodbye!

3. Aside from the answer in the previous question, write two
   alternative ways of printing Hello! and Goodbye! to the screen on
   two different lines.
   #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     cout << "Hello!\nGoodbye!" << endl;
     cout << "Hello!" << endl << "Goodbye!" << endl;
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Hello!
   : Goodbye!
   : Hello!
   : Goodbye!

4. Write several lines of code using the =width()= and =fill()= functions
   in a =main()= function that prints ~Programming!~ to the screen with 4
   'x' characters printed aer it.

   Information: =width= returns the minimum number of characters for the
   next output field, and =fill= sets the fill character for padding
   fields:
   #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both
     cout.fill('x');
     cout.width(16);
     cout << "Programming!" << endl;
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : xxxxProgramming!

   This last example prints the padding characters before the
   number. To set the field width after the output use the =left=
   function after =cout=:
   #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     cout.fill('x');
     cout.width(16);
     cout << left << "Programming!" << endl;
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Programming!xxxx

5. Write code to output the values 124, 12.376, z, 1000000, and
   strings! as distinct values, separated by spaces.
   #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     cout << 124        << " "
     << 12.376     << " "
     << 'z'        << " "
     << 1000000    << " "
     << "strings!" << endl;
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 124 12.376 z 1000000 strings!

6. What is the output of the following program?
   #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> <string> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     string shirt = "maroon", pants = "blue";
     cout << shirt << " " << pants << endl;
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : maroon blue

* Chapter 6: Input

- To enter data from standard input devices, use =cin= with the standard
  extraction operator =>>=.

- To check for improper input you can use =cin.fail=:
  #+begin_src C++ :tangle src/fail.cpp :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both
    int x = 0, y = 0;

    cout << "Please enter a value for x: " << endl;
    cin >> x;
    if (cin.fail()) {
      cout << "That is not a valid data type!" << endl;
     } else {
      cout << "You entered: " << x << endl;
     }
  #+end_src

** Review questions

#+begin_src bash :results output
  echo "500" > data/input
  cat data/input
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 500

1. Which of the following numbered lines of code are proper =cin= statements?
   #+begin_example C++
     // variable declarations
     int x=0,y=0;
     // ask for input
     cout << "Please enter a value for x: ";
     // get input
     cin << x; // #1
     cin >> x; // #2
     cin >> x // #3
     cin x; // #4
     cin >< x; // #5
     x >> cin; // #6
   #+end_example

   Solution:
   #+begin_src C++ :cmdline < data/input :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     // variable declarations
     int x=0;
     // ask for input
     cout << "Please enter a value for x: ";
     // get input
     //cin << x; // #1
     cin >> x; // #2
     //cin >> x // #3
     //cin x; // #4
     //cin >< x; // #5
     //x >> cin; // #6
     cout << endl << "You entered: " << x << endl;
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Please enter a value for x:
   : You entered: 500

2. Must you always use =cin= with =cout=? Why or why not?
   #+begin_quote
   No, input and output are separate commands and processes. You can
   use =cin= for input, or =scanf=, and =cout= or =printf= for output.
   #+end_quote

3. What is the "redirect" or "extraction" operator , and how is it
   used to process user input?
   #+begin_quote
   - In C++, the operator =>>= redirects input from its left into output
     on its right.
   - On the shell, there is also a redirection operator, =>= or =<=, which
     redirects the input on its left or right into files on the
     opposite side. The operators =>>= and =<<= append to the file rather
     than rewrite it.
   #+end_quote

4. Can you use =cin= to store a value in a variable that already has a
   value?
   #+begin_quote
   Yes, and the previous value is overwritten.
   #+end_quote

5. Write code that allows the user to enter an integer value and store
   it in a variable. Your code should prompt the user, receive their
   input, and then print their input value back to them.
   #+begin_src C++ :cmdline < data/input :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     int x;
     cout << "Enter integer value: ";
     cin >> x;
     cout << "\nYou entered: " << x << endl;
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Enter integer value:
   : You entered: 500

6. Add some functionality to the code you wrote for the previous
   exercise. Add two new variables, one =char= and one =float= or
   =double=. Prompt the user properly for each value. e program should
   print out the values of the variables, clearly labeled, on separate
   lines.
   #+begin_src bash :results output
     echo "29121963 M 180.34" > data/input
     cat data/input
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 29121963 M 180.34

   #+begin_src C++ :cmdline < data/input :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     // variable declarations
     int foo;
     char bar;
     float baz;
     // input
     cout << "Enter integer, character, and floating-point number, separated by space(s): ";
     cin >> foo >> bar >> baz;
     // failsafe
     if (cin.fail()) cout << "\nNot valid input\n";
     // output
     cout << "\nYou entered: "
     << foo << " (integer)" << endl
     << bar << " (character)" << endl
     << baz << " (floating-point number)" << endl;
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Enter integer, character, and floating-point number, separated by space(s):
   : You entered: 29121963 (integer)
   : M (character)
   : 180.34 (floating-point number)

* Chapter 8: Comments

** Review questions

#+begin_src bash :results output
  echo "10" > data/input
  cat data/input
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 10

1. Comment each line of this code:
   #+begin_src C++ :cmdline < data/input :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     #include <iostream>
     using namespace std;

     int main()
     {
       int time;
       cout << "Enter time in seconds:\n";
       cin >> time;
       cout << "You entered: " << time << " seconds." << endl;
       int answer = (32 * time * time) / 2;
       cout << "The distance is ";
       cout << answer;
       cout << " feet.\n";
       return 0;
     }
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Enter time in seconds:
   : You entered: 10 seconds.
   : The distance is 1600 feet.

   *Background:* In the imperial metric system, 32 feet per second
   squared (or 9.8 meter per second squared in the metric system) is
   the approximate acceleration due to Earth's gravity for a freely
   falling body (no air friction or other effects assumed).

   Solution:
   #+begin_src C++ :cmdline < data/input :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     // Load input output header file
     #include <iostream>
     // use standard namespace
     using namespace std;
     // main function - no arguments, returns integer
     int main()
     { // body of main function begins
       // declare integer variable `time`
       int time;

       cout << "Enter time in seconds:\n";
       // Stream user input from standard device to variable `time`
       cin >> time;
       // Tell user which number he entered.
       cout << "You entered: " << time << " seconds." << endl;

   : The distance is 1600 feet.

2. Fix this code by removing or modifying comments so that it runs and
   compiles as it should.
   #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     /* #include <iostream> includes the iostream *

        using namespace std;

        int main()
        {
        int time;                // A place to store the time
        cout << "Enter time \n": // Ask to enter the time
        cin >> time;             // Takes user input
        int answer = (32 * time * time) / 2; // Calculates it
        cout << "The distance is ";          /* Outputs
        cout << answer;                         the distance
        cout << " feet.\n";                     in meters */
     return 0;
     }
   #+end_src

   Solution:
   #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     /*  includes the iostream */
     #include <iostream>
     using namespace std;

     int main()
     {
       int time;                // A place to store the time
       cout << "Enter time \n"; // Ask to enter the time
       cin >> time;             // Takes user input
       int answer = (32 * time * time) / 2; // Calculates it
       cout << "The distance is ";          // Outputs
       cout << answer;                      // the distance
       cout << " feet.\n";                  // in meters
       return 0;
     }
   #+end_src

3. Explain the purpose of commenting.
   #+begin_quote
   Commenting helps clarifying the purpose behind code, and
   understanding it line by line and word for word.
   #+end_quote
   How does it help you?
   #+begin_quote
   It would helps me in particular if I read someone else's code so
   that I could understand its purpose and the algorithms behind
   it. It helps me if I'm coming back to my code to understand what
   I've been doing.
   #+end_quote
   Why would someone else need to be able to understand your code?
   #+begin_quote
   Because most programs are not short programs written by just one
   person in an instant, but they are large, written, improved, and
   extended by many different programmers.
   #+end_quote

4. Write and properly comment your own simple program.

   Solution:

   A "hello" program that greets the user with his name.

   Input:
   #+begin_src bash :results output
     echo "Marcus" > data/input
     cat data/input
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Marcus

   Code:
   #+begin_src C++ :cmdline < data/input :results output :exports both
     /* Get user name from keyboard and welcome him by name */
     /* Sample input: Marcus
        /* Sample output: "Hello, Marcus"  */

     #include <iostream> // include I/O header file
     #include <string>  // include string methods

     using namespace std; // don't need to use std:: in front of cout, cin, endl

     int main() {  // begin main function (returns control integer)

       string name; // declare user name for input operation

       cout << "Enter your first name:\n"; // ask user for input
       cin >> name; // get user name as input

       // print personalized welcome message
       cout << "Hello, " + name << "!" << endl;

       return 0; // return control integer: 0 = all OK
     } // end main function
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Enter your first name:
   : Hello, Marcus!

5. Go back to the program you wrote from the previous question. Add
   further comments that explain what’s happening and share the
   commented code with a classmate or friend. Ask them if they
   understand what’s happening from just the comments.

   Solution:

   "Only the comments" should read like pseudocode:
   #+begin_example
     // include I/O header file
     // include string methods

     // don't need to use std:: in front of cout, cin, endl

     // begin main function (returns control integer)
       // declare user name for input operation
       // ask user for input
       // get user name as input
       // print personalized welcome message
       // return control integer: 0 = all OK
     // end main function
   #+end_example

6. Add comments to the following code.

   - Note: Save percentages in hockey are shown to three decimal
     places and not multiplied by 100: .900 instead of 90%.

     #+begin_src C++ :cmdline < data/input :results output :exports both :comments both
       #include <iostream>
       #include <cstdlib>
       using namespace std;

         char cont;

         do {
           cout.unsetf(ios::fixed);
           cout.unsetf(ios::showpoint);

           cout << "Enter the number of shots on goal:\t";
           cin >> shots;
           cout << "Enter the number of goals scored:\t";
           cin >> goals;
           cout << endl;

           saves = shots - goals;
           save_perc = (saves / shots);

           cout << "If there were " << shots << " shots and "
                << goals << " goals\n";
           cout << "then the goalie's save percentage was ";

           cout.setf(ios::fixed);
           cout.setf(ios::showpoint);
           cout.precision(3);

           cout << save_perc << endl << endl;

           cout << "Run again? Y/N\t";
           cin >> cont;
           cont = toupper(cont);
         } while (cont == 'Y');
         return 0;
       }

- Automatic types in C++11: the =auto= type leaves the typing to the
  compiler
  #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
    auto myVar = 3; // int

- The =decltype= operator extracts types from objects:
  #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
    auto myVar = 3; // int
    decltype(myVar) myVar4; // int - myVar4 not initialized

    v.push_back(2) // add element 2 to vector
    v.push_back(8) // add element 8 to vector
    auto myIterator = v.begin(); // equivalent to:
                                 // std::vector<int>::iterator myIterator
                                 // = v.begin();
  #+end_example

** Review questions

1. What’s the difference between the various data types that store
   numbers? Why would you use one over the other?
   #+begin_quote
   - The difference is memory size.
   - You'd choose one over the other to accommodate data, e.g. to
     store a number with decimal points, choose =float= or =double=, or to
     choose a TRUE or FALSE value, choose =bool=.
   #+end_quote

2. If you assign the result of an =int= divided by an =int= to a =float=
   (e.g. ~float num = 13/7;~), what could happen to the resulting value?
   #+begin_quote
   - The result of 13/7 is coerced to an integer (1)
   - The variable ~num~ converts the 1 to 1.0 (widening conversion)
   #+end_quote

   Show this:
   #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     float num = 13/7;
     cout << num << endl;
     printf("%.1f",num);
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 1
   : 1.0

   This last =printf= shows the floating-point character, because if you
   print it as an integer, you see that it's a =float= (with warning):
   #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     float num = 13/7;
     cout << num << endl;
     printf("%d",num);
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 1
   : 0

- You can also use =typeid= from =<typeinfo>=:
  #+begin_src C++ :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
    #include <iostream>
    #include <typeinfo>
    using namespace std;

    int main()
    {
      auto num = 13/7;
      auto num2 = 13.f/7.f;

      double num3 = 13/7;

      cout << "The type of num is: " << typeid(num).name() << endl;
      cout << "The type of num2 is: " << typeid(num2).name() << endl;
      cout << "The type of num3 is: " << typeid(num3).name() << endl;
      return 0;
    }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : The type of num is: i
  : The type of num2 is: f
  : The type of num3 is: d

3. Declare a variable named ~sampleSize~ and set it to 14.58093.
   #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results none :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     double sampleSize = 14.58093;
   #+end_src

4. Write code that increases sampleSize by 12.495.
   #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     double sampleSize = 14.58093;
     sampleSize += 12.495;
     cout << sampleSize << endl;
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:

* Chapter 11: Strings

- In order to use strings you must =#include <string>=.

- A string can be treated like a 1-dim array of characters.

- when a literal is assigned to a =string=, it needs to be in ""

- Importing strings: a whitespace is seen as the end of the input
  #+begin_src  C++ :cmdline < data/string :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
    string myString;
    cin >> myString;
    cout << myString;
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Hello+string+world

  #+begin_src bash :results output
    echo "Hello string world" > data/string
    cat data/string
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Hello string world

- So how can we print the whole string? Use the =getline= function:
  #+begin_src C++ :cmdline < data/string :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
    string myString;
    getline(cin, myString);
    cout << myString;
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Hello string world

- What about strings split up over different lines?
  #+begin_src bash :results output
    echo "Hello string world" >> data/string
    cat data/string
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Hello string world
  : Hello string world

- Only the first line is fetched!

- Length of string:
  #+begin_src C++ :cmdline < data/string :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
    #include <string>
    string myString;
    int stringLength;
    getline(cin, myString);
    stringLength = myString.length();
    cout << stringLength;
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 18

- You can search for certain characters in a string using =string::find=
  and =string::rfind= member functions:
  #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
    string myString = "Hello World";
    int spot = myString.find(" ");
    cout << spot << endl; // output 5 for the 5th string element
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 5

- Memory image:
  #+attr_html: :width 400px:
  [[../img/myString.png]]

- You can also search within a string from another position than the
  beginning:
  #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
    string myString = "Hello World";
    int spot, spot2;
    spot = myString.find(" "); // looks for space - found at index 5
    spot2 = myString.find("o",spot); // looks for 'o' - starting from index 5, finds 7
    cout << spot << " " << spot2 << endl;
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 5 7

- The =rfind= function finds a character in reverse direction from the
  end of the string:
  #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
    string myString = "Hello World";
    int spot, spot2, spot3;
    spot = myString.rfind(" "); // looks for space from end - found at index 5
    spot2 = myString.rfind("o",spot); // looks from end for 'o' - starts from 5, finds 4
    spot3 = myString.rfind("o",5); // looks from end for 'o' - starts from 5, finds 4
    cout << spot << " " << spot2 << " " << spot3 << endl;
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 5 4 4

- The finding functions return the position of the last occurrence, or
  =std::string::npos= if the substring is not found:
  #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
    #include <iostream>
    #include <string>

    using namespace std;

    int main() {
      string myString = "Hello World!";
      string substring = "o";

      // Find the last occurrence of the substring in the main string
      size_t position = myString.find(substring); // output 4
      //size_t position_r = myString.rfind(substring); // output 7

      // Check if the substring was found
      if (position != string::npos) {
        cout << "Last occurrence of substring found at position: " << position << endl;
      } else {
        cout << "Substring not found." << endl;
      }

      return 0;
    }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Last occurrence of substring found at position: 4

- The data type =size_t= is used for unsigned size data - it is
  optimized for whatever computing platform you're using.

** Review questions

1. Write code to declare a string and take input from a user.
   #+begin_src C++ :cmdline < data/string :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     #include <string>
     string  myString;
     cin >> myString;
     cout << myString;
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Hello

2. Can a string be treated as a character array?
   #+begin_quote
   Yes.
   #+end_quote

3. When do you use a string?
   #+begin_quote
   When you need to hold a sequence of characters, words, sentences.
   #+end_quote
4. What is the =#include= needed to use strings?
   #+begin_quote
   =<string>=
   #+end_quote
5. What function do you have to use to take an input with a space?
   #+begin_quote
   =std::string::getline=
   #+end_quote
6. Write code that takes in 5 words (one after the other, not at once)
   and outputs each of them 4 times.
   #+begin_src bash :results output
     echo "One Two Three Four Five" > data/words
     cat data/words
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : One Two Three Four Five

   #+begin_src C++ :cmdline < data/words :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     #include <string>

     string word;

     puts("Enter first word");
     cin >> word;
     cout << word << endl;
     puts("Enter second word");
     cin >> word;
     cout << word << endl;
     puts("Enter third word");
     cin >> word;
     cout << word << endl;
     puts("Enter fourth word");
     cin >> word;
     cout << word << endl;
     puts("Enter fifth word");
     cin >> word;
     cout << word << endl;
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   #+begin_example
   Enter first word
   One
   Enter second word
   Two
   Enter third word
   Three
   Enter fourth word
   Four
   Enter fifth word
   Five
   #+end_example

7. Write a program that takes in an input of at least two words of the
   same length. e program should then switch the last word and the
   first word.

   Pseudocode - the simpler case of 2 words:
   #+begin_example
   // Input: 2 words of the same length, e.g. "hello" and "world".
   // Output: switch word order: "world" "hello"

   // 1. Get input with `getline` and store it in `words`

   // 2. Get the length of the string with the two words with `length`

   // 3. Identify the index of the space between the two words with `find`

   // 4. Print the two substrings
   #+end_example

   We can use either the length (it tells us that the string is 5 +
   1 + 5 characters), or store the index for the whitespace.

   Let's see how we can print the words:
   #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     #include <string>

     // input data
     string words = "hello world";
     //cout << words << endl; // hello world
     // length of string
     int words_length = words.length();
     // cout << words_length << endl; // length of words
     // print string character-wise
     for (char c : words) { // range based for loop
       cout << c; // print characters
      }
     cout << endl;
     // find space between the words
     int space = words.find(" "); // 5
     // print words starting from beginning (1st word)
     for (int i=0; i<space; i++) {
       cout << words[i]; // print characters
      }
     cout << endl;
     // print words starting from space (2nd word)
     for (int i=space+1; i<words_length; i++) {
       cout << words[i]; // print characters
      }
     // create words_reverse as a string
     string words_rev;
     // initialize words_reverse from the back
     // fill string with second word
     for (int i=space+1; i<words_length; i++) {
       //cout << words[i]; // print characters
       words_rev[i-space-1] = words[i];
      }
     // add white space after the first word
     words_rev[space] = ' ';
     // continue with first word
     for (int i=0; i<space; i++) {
       //cout << words[i]; // print characters
       words_rev[i+space+1] = words[i];
      }
     // print result
     cout << endl;
     for (int i=0;i<words_length;i++) {
       cout << words_rev[i];
      }
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : hello world
   : hello
   : world
   : world hello

- Shorter version without the intermediate printout and checks:
  #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
    #include <string>
    string words = "hello world";
    int words_length = words.length(); // length of string
    for (char c : words) cout << c;  // print string character-wise
    int space = words.find(" ");  // find space between the words
    string words_rev; // create words_reverse as a string
    for (int i=space+1; i<words_length; i++)  words_rev[i-space-1] = words[i];
    words_rev[space] = ' ';
    for (int i=0; i<space; i++) words_rev[i+space+1] = words[i];
    cout << endl;
    for (int i=0;i<words_length;i++) cout << words_rev[i];
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:

    #include <string>
    string words = "hello world";  // Input data

    int space = words.find(" ");   // Find space between the words
    string first_word = words.substr(0, space);        // Extract the first word
    string second_word = words.substr(space + 1);      // Extract the second word
    string words_rev = second_word + " " + first_word; // Concatenate in reverse order
    cout << words_rev << endl;
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : hello world
  : world hello

* Chalter 12: Loops

- Wrap the program [[compare a and b]] from "conditionals" in an infinite
  loop, and ask the user after each iteration if he wants to quit or
  continue playing, exit the program accordinly, and print the number
  of iterations. Play at least once.
  #+name: compare and and b with break
  #+begin_src C++ :cmdline < data/compare :tangle src/compare.cpp :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both

      // Ask for user input
      cout << "Enter two numbers: ";
      // Store input in variables
      cin >> a >> b;
      // check for valid input
      if (cin.fail()) {
        cout << "Invalid input. Please enter two integers!" << endl;
        break;

- =while= loops and =do while= loops can be event-controlled or counter
  controlled: The previous program was event-controlled (event = user
  enters Y), or you could use a counter variable:
  #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
    int counter = 1;
    while (counter) {
      cout << "counting down!" << endl;

     }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:

** Review questions

1. Create a =while= loop that increments some integer variable x
   initialized with a value of 0 by 3 until the value of x reaches a
   value of 30. Make sure you declare the variable and initialize it
   first!
   #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     int x = 0;
     while (x < 30) x+=3;
     cout << x << endl;
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 30

2. Create a =do-while= loop that reads integer values given by the user
   into an integer variable x, initialized to 0, then adds those
   values onto some variable named =totalVal= until =totalVal= reaches at
   least 20.
   #+begin_src bash :results output
     echo "1 3 5 3 4 2 1 1 2 2 3 4" > data/totalval
     cat data/totalval
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 1 3 5 3 4 2 1 1 2 2 3 4

   Solution:
   #+begin_src C++ :cmdline < data/totalval :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     int x = 0;
     int totalVal = 0;
     int counter = 0;
     do {
       cin >> x;
       cout << x << endl;
       totalVal += x;
       counter ++;
      } while (totalVal < 20);
     cout << "Reached " << totalVal << " after " << counter << " iterations." << endl;
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 1

   : 1
   : 1
   : Reached 20 after 8 iterations.

3. Create a =for= loop that outputs your =name= to the screen 10 times
   before exiting the loop.

   Solution I:

     for (int i=0; i<10; i++) {
       cout << "Marcus" << endl;
      }
   #+end_src

   Solution II (storing the name as a =string= type):
   #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     #include <string> // include string library

     string name = "Marcus"; // set name string variable

     for (int i=0; i<10; i++) {
       cout << name << endl;
      }
   #+end_src

4. Spot the syntax and the logic errors and correct it in the
   following code:
   #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     for (int j=10, j>0, j--)
       {
         cout << j << endl;
         if (j=1)
           {
             cout << "BOOM!\n";
           }
       }
   #+end_src

   Solution:
   1) The separator in the =for= condition was wrong.
   2) The condition ~if(j=1)~ changes j from 10 to 1 in the first
      iteration, enters the if-statement body, and finishes.

   Fixed code:
   #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     for (int j=10; j>0; j--) // separator must be semi-colon, not comma
       {
         cout << j << endl;
         if (j==1)  // condition must be logical ==, not assignment =
           {
             cout << "BOOM!\n";
           }
       }
   #+end_src

5. In the last question, was the loop an event-controlled loop or a
   count-controlled loop? Answer: count-controlled (i was the counter
   variable).

    string scott = Scott;
    char Scott2[] = {'S','c','o','t','t','\0'};
    cout << Scott << endl;
    cout << scott.length() << endl;
    cout << Scott2 << endl;

* Chapter 14: Blocks, Functions, and Scope

- You can overload function names, that is use the same name
  but with different definitions. Example:
  #+begin_example C++
    int add(int num1, int num2);
    double add(double num1, double num2);
  #+end_example

- The functions have the same (overloaded) name but different return
  types and function parameters, which are locak in scope.
  #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
    // function 1
    int add(int num1, int num2) {
      return num1 + num2;
    }
    // function 2
    double add(double num1, double num2) {
      return num1 + num2;
    }
    int main() {
      cout << "1 + 1 = " << add(1, 1) << endl;
      cout << "3 + 0.14 = " << add(3., .14) << endl;
      return 0;
    }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 1 + 1 = 2
  : 3 + 0.14 = 3.14

** Review questions:

1. What are the three parts of a function?
   #+begin_quote
   1. Return type
   2. function name
   3. function parameters
   #+end_quote

2. Can a =void= function return a value?
   #+begin_quote
   No. The =void= return type is defined as "no return value". The =void=
   parameter is a placeholder for "no parameter/argument".
   #+end_quote

3. How many functions can one program have?
   #+begin_quote
   As many as you want (and as many as there is memory for your
   programs): functions are sections of code that allow reuse and
   modularization of your program.
   #+end_quote

4. What is the output of the following code snippet?
   #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     #include <iostream>
     using namespace std;

     void example();

     void example() {
       cout << "Hello World";
     }

     int main() {
       return 0;
     }

   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:

   Answer:
   #+begin_quote
   There is no output:
   - The first ~example~ function does nothing (no body)
   - The second ~example~ function returns nothing but would print out
     the string "Hello World" but it is never called (in =main=).
   #+end_quote

5. Write code using at least one function that will ask the user to
   guess a “magic” number (of your choice) between 1 and 20 until they
   get it right.  Aer a guess, the program should output whether the
   number they guessed is higher or lower than the “magic” number. It
   should also display how many guesses the user makes, and loop until
   the guess is correct.

   Solution:
   - This is a guess-a-number program, or a game, which requires some
     serious thought (in any language), so we'll begin with
     pseudocode:
     #+begin_example
     /* Guess-a-number game; user must guess computer's number in a loop */
     /* Input: integer number guess (from user) between 1 and 20                          */
     /* Output: if guess higher/lower (each iteration), total guesses    */
     /* (CC-BY-NC) Marcus Birkenkrahe modified from Rook's Guide (2013)  */
     /* ---------------------------------------------------------------- */

     // compare int function: pass guess and computer's number
       // check if numbers are equal - return 0
       // check if guess > number - msg "guess too high" & return 1
       // check if guess < number - msg "guess too low"  & return 1

     // main program
       // declare user guess variable
       // set computer number randomly with rand
       // set counter to zero
       // begin do-while loop
         // get user guess
         // increase counter
         // compare (guess, number)
         // if return 0 end game
         // otherwise check if user wants to quit (Y)
         // end while (input != 'Y')
       // print counter (number of guesses)
     #+end_example

   - Code: tangle and compile as ~src/guess.cpp~
     #+begin_src C++ :tangle src/guess.cpp :results silent :exports both
       /* Guess-a-number game; user must guess computer's number in a loop */

         // check if numbers are equal - return 0
         if (guess == number) {
           return 0;
         } // check if guess > number too high" & return 1
         else if (guess > number) {
           cout << "guess too high" << endl;
           return 1;
         } // check if guess < number - msg "guess too low"  & return 1
         else {
           cout << "guess too low" << endl;
           return 1;
         }
       }
       // main program
       int main() {
         // Seed the random number generator with the current time
         srand(time(nullptr));
         // set computer number [0,100] randomly with rand
         int number = rand() % 20 + 1;
         // set counter to zero
         int counter = 1;
         // declare user guess
         int guess;
         // variable for quitting
         char quit;
         // begin do-while loop
         do {
           // get user guess
           cout << "[" << counter << "] "
                << "Guess a number between 0 and 20: ";
           cin >> guess;
           // compare (guess, number)
           if (!compare(guess,number)) { // returns 0 for same, 1 for not
             cout << "You got it!" << endl;
             break;
           }
           // increase counter
           counter++;
           // otherwise check if user wants to quit (Y)
           cout << "Another guess? Type Y for yes or N for no:\n";
           cin >> quit;
         } while (quit!='N'); // end while (input != 'Y')
         // print counter (number of guesses)
         cout << "You guessed " << counter << " times." << endl;

6. Using at least one function, write code that prompts the user for a
   number of miles travelled and a number of hours, then calculates
   the user’s speed in miles per hour.
   #+begin_src C++ :cmdline < data/mph :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both

     /* Output: With __ miles in __ hours, your average speed was __ mph */
     /* (CC-BY-NC) Marcus Birkenkrahe modified from Rook's Guide (2013)  */
     /* ---------------------------------------------------------------- */
     #include <iostream>

     double mph(double miles,double hours) {
       return miles / hours;
     }

     int main() {

       // variable declarations
       double milesTravelled, hoursTravelled;

       // Get user input
       cout << "Enter miles and hours travelled: ";
       cin >> milesTravelled >> hoursTravelled;
       cout << endl;

       //compute and print result
       cout << "With " << milesTravelled << " miles in "
            << hoursTravelled << " hours, your speed was "
            << mph(milesTravelled,hoursTravelled) << " mph." << endl;
       return 0;
     }
   #+end_src

* Chapter 15: Problem Solving & Troubleshooting

** Review questions

1. Consider the following function, which is supposed to add up four
   floating-point numbers and divide their sum by 4:
   #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     double average(double s1, double s2, double s3, s4);
     {
       retun s1+s2+s3+s4/4
         }
   #+end_src

- Find the syntax errors in the function.
  #+begin_quote
  1) missing data type for s4 parameter [found by compiler]
  2) superfluous semi-colon in the first line
  3) misspelled =return= [found by compiler]
  4) missing semi-colon
  #+end_quote
- ere is a logic error in the function. What is it? How does it
  affect the output of the code?
  #+begin_quote
  The sum needs to be put in parentheses.
  #+end_quote

  Fixed program:
  #+begin_src C++ :results output :exports both
    // Add four floating-point numbers and divide their sum by 4
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;
    // function definition
    double average(double s1, double s2, double s3, double s4)
    {
      return (s1+s2+s3+s4)/4.0;
    }
    // main function
    int main()
    {
      // function call and print out
      cout << average(1.,2.,3.,4.) << endl; // should print 10/4=2.5
      cout.precision(2); // set precision to 2
      cout.setf(ios::showpoint); // show decimal point
      cout << average(4.,4.,4.,4.) << endl; // should print 10/4=2.5

2. The program below (same as: [[hockey]]) compiles, but does not get the
   result the programmer wanted. Why?
   #+begin_src C++ :cmdline < data/hockey :results output :exports both
     #include <iostream>
     using namespace std;

       cout << "Enter the number of shots on goal:\t";
       cin >> shots;
       cout << "Enter the number of goals scored:\t";
       cin >> goals;
       cout << endl;

       saves = shots-goals;
       // Hockey shows save % as decimal to three places
       save_perc = (saves / shots);
       cout << "If there were " << shots
            << " shots and "    << goals
            << " goals, "

       cout << save_perc << endl << endl;
       return 0;
     }
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Enter the number of shots on goal: Enter the number of goals scored:

     cat data/hockey
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 1000 999

   Solution:
   #+begin_quote
   - Remove the unused variable ~cont~ and the =cout.unsetf= lines.
   - Change data type for the input ~shots~, ~goals~ and the result ~saves~
     to =double= (otherwise an integer result will be truncated).

* Chapter 18: File I/O
** file data stream classes in the =fstream= library

- A file can be opened for both reading and writing, and accessed by
  both input and output streams.

- C++ has the =ifstream=, =ofstream=, and =fstream= classes for reading from
  and writing to files. They're available through the =fstream= library:
  #+begin_src C++ :results silent :exports both
    #include <iostream>
    #include <fstream>

    using namespace std;

    int main() {
      // Declare variable of type ifstream named inFile
      ifstream inFile;

      // Declare variable of type ofstream named outFile
      ofstream outFile;

      // open text file for input
      inFile.open("InputTextFile");

      // create text file for output
      outFile.open("OutputTextFile");

      // code here

      // close input and output files:
      inFile.close();
      outFile.close();
      return 0;
    }
  #+end_src

- Was an output file created?
  #+begin_src bash :results output
    ls -lt *Text*
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : -rw-rw-r-- 1 marcus marcus 0 Jul  8 18:15 OutputTextFile
  : -rw-rw-r-- 1 marcus marcus 5 Jul  8 18:12 InputTextFile.txt
  : -rw-rw-r-- 1 marcus marcus 0 Jul  8 18:08 OutputTextFile.txt

** Reading from file

- Put a number into ~InputTextFile.txt~:
  #+begin_src bash :results output
    echo "1000" > InputTextFile
    cat InputTextFile
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 1000

  - Now read data from an input file, use the insertion operator =>>=
    with =inFile=:
  #+begin_src C++ :results output :exports both
    #include <iostream>
    #include <fstream>
    using namespace std;
    int main() {
      // declare and initialize variable with number
      int number = 5;
      cout << "Created in program: " << number << endl;
      // declare and open input file
      ifstream inFile;
      inFile.open("InputTextFile");
      inFile >> number; // insert number from the input file &
                        // store it in the variable number
      cout << "Inserted from file: " << number << endl;

      // close input file
      inFile.close();
      return 0;
    }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Created in program: 5
  : Inserted from file: 1000

** Writing to file

- Reversely, write a character to the (empty) ~OutputTextFile~:
  #+begin_src C++ :results output :exports both
    #include <iostream>
    #include <fstream>
    using namespace std;
    int main() {
      // declare and initialize variable with letter
      char Letter = 'A';
      cout << "Created in program: " << Letter << endl;
      // declare and open output file
      ofstream outFile;
      outFile.open("OutputTextFile");
      outFile << Letter; // extract Letter & store it in the outFile
      outFile.close();

      // To check, you could open the file, or write it back here into
      // another char variable:
      char Letter2;
      // declare and open input file
      ifstream inFile;
      inFile.open("OutputTextFile");
      inFile >> Letter2;
      inFile.close();

      cout << "Read from OutputTextFile: " << Letter2 << endl;

      return 0;
    }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Created in program: A
  : Read from OutputTextFile: A

- How about doing this with Orgmode =:includes= and =:main=?
  #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> <fstream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both
    // declare and initialize variable with letter
    char Letter = 'A';
    cout << "Created in program: " << Letter << endl;
    // declare and open output file
    ofstream outFile;
    outFile.open("OutputTextFile");
    outFile << Letter; // extract Letter & store it in the outFile
    outFile.close();

    // To check, you could open the file, or write it back here into
    // another char variable:
    char Letter2;
    // declare and open input file
    ifstream inFile;
    inFile.open("OutputTextFile");
    inFile >> Letter2;
    inFile.close();

    cout << "Read from OutputTextFile: " << Letter2 << endl;
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Created in program: A
  : Read from OutputTextFile: A

** Create char input and output functions (Practice)

- Put these into functions: starting with =outFile=
  #+begin_src C++ :includes <iostream> <fstream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both
    # include <string>
    // output function
    void output(char var, string file) {
      // declare and open output file
      ofstream outFile;
      outFile.open(file);
      outFile << var; // extract Letter & store it in the outFile
      outFile.close();
    }
    // main function
    int main() {

      // declare and initialize variable with letter
      char Letter = 'A';
      cout << "Created in program: " << Letter << endl;

      // send output to file
      output(Letter,"OutputTextFile");

      // To check, you could open the file, or write it back here into
      // another char variable:
      char Letter2;
      // declare and open input file
      ifstream inFile;
      inFile.open("OutputTextFile");
      inFile >> Letter2;
      inFile.close();

      cout << "Read from OutputTextFile: " << Letter2 << endl;
      return 0;
    }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Created in program: A
  : Read from OutputTextFile: A

- Next: =inFile=
  #+begin_src C++ :includes <iostream> <fstream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both
    # include <string>
    // character output function
    void char_out(char var, string file) {
      // declare and open output file
      ofstream outFile;
      outFile.open(file);
      outFile << var; // extract Letter & store it in the outFile
      outFile.close();
    }
    // character input function
    char char_in(string file) {
      char var;
      // declare and open input file
      ifstream inFile;
      inFile.open(file);
      inFile >> var;
      inFile.close();
      return var;
    }
    // main function
    int main() {

      // declare and initialize variable with letter
      char Letter = 'A';
      cout << "Created in program: " << Letter << endl;

      // send output to file
      char_out(Letter,"OutputTextFile");

      // To check, you could open the file, or write it back here into
      // another char variable:
      char Letter2;

      // insert input from file
      Letter2 = char_in("OutputTextFile");

      cout << "Read from OutputTextFile: " << Letter2 << endl;
      return 0;
    }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Created in program: A
  : Read from OutputTextFile: A

** Other File I/O functions: =fail=, =eof=, =get=, =put=

- The =fstream::fail= function determines whether the file was opened
  successfully or not:
  #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> <fstream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
    ifstream inFile;
    inFile.open("inputFile");
    if (inFile.fail()) cout << "Failed to open!" << endl;
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Failed to open!

- Create ~inputFile~ first, then run code above again:
  #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> <fstream> <filesystem> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
    ofstream outFile;
    outFile.open("inputFile");
    // check if "inputFile" exists
    cout << "inputFile exists: " << std::filesystem::exists("inputFile") << endl;
    ifstream inFile;
    inFile.open("inputFile");
    if (inFile.fail()) {
      cout << "Failed to open!" << endl;
     } else {
      cout << "File open!" << endl;
     }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : inputFile exists: 1
  : File open!

- The =eof= function tests to see if the stream has reached the end of
  the file. This is useful to find out when to stop reading from the
  file.

  Let's put some stuff in the ~inputFile~:
  #+begin_src bash :results output
    echo "100 200 300" > inputFile
    cat inputFile
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 100 200 300

  Try this now:
  #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> <fstream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
    int number;
    ifstream inFile;
    inFile.open("inputFile");
    inFile >> number;
    while (!inFile.eof()) inFile >> number; // fetches the last number
    cout << number << endl;
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 400

- =get= and =put= are the equivalent of C's =getchar= and =putchar= (in
  =<stdio.h>=) and work with =ifstream= or =cin=, and =ofstream= or =cout=.

- =get= reads the next character typed on the keyboard or from file
  (including spaces, tabs or newline):
  #+begin_src C++ :cmdline < InputTextFile :main yes :includes <iostream> <fstream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
    char c1,c2;
    ifstream inFile;
    inFile.open("InputTextFile");
    // get character from keyboard
    cin.get(c2);
    // get character from file
    inFile.get(c1);
    inFile.close();
    // print results
    cout << "Keyboard char: " << c1 << endl;
    cout << "File char: " << c2 << endl;
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Keyboard char: B
  : File char: B

- =put= outputs one character:
  #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> <fstream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
    char c = '\n';
    ofstream outFile;
    outFile.open("newline");

    cout.put(c); // write to screen
    outFile.put(c); // writes to file
    outFile.close();
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  :

- Check that the output file contains a newline character:
  #+begin_src bash :results output
    cat -A newline
    hexdump -C newline
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : $
  : 00000000  0a                                                |.|

       ofstream output;
       // open a text file for output
       output.open("Textfile.txt");
       output << "Hello world";
       // close the output text file
       output.close();
       return 0;
     }
   #+end_src
   Check:
   #+begin_src bash :results output
     cat Textfile.txt
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Hello world

8. What kind of function is the =eof()= function and what does it do?
   #+begin_quote
   The =eof= function is a member function of the =istream= class in the
   STD library =<fstream>=.  It checks if the end of a file is reached
   during reading or writing.
   #+end_quote
   Example:
   #+begin_src C++  :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     #include <iostream>
     #include <fstream>
     #include <string>
     using namespace std;

     int main() {
       string hw;
       // declare input object
       ifstream input;
       // open a text file for input
       input.open("Textfile.txt");
       while (!input.eof()) input >> hw;
       // output result
       cout << hw << endl;
       return 0;
     }
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : world

9. What are the benefits of using files for input and output?
   #+begin_quote
   Ability to store files permanently (output) and read from files
   (input) many times over without having to recreate the data.
   #+end_quote

10. What is the difference between =cin >> c;= and =cin.get(c);= if c is
    of type =char=?
    #+begin_quote
    =cin >> c= stores the next non-whitespace character, while
    =cin.get(c)= stores the next character, whitespace or not.
    #+end_quote
11. Write a program that outputs the (numeric) contents of some file to the
    screen.

    Input file:
    #+begin_src bash :results output
      echo "100 200" > inputFile
      cat input
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS:
    : 100 5

    Solution:
    #+begin_src C++ :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
      #include <iostream>
      #include <fstream>
      using namespace std;

      int main() {
        // declare numeric variable
        int num;
        // delare input file
        ifstream input;
        // open input file
        input.open("inputFile");
        // get input from file
        input >> num;
        // print result
        cout << num << endl;
        // check if there isn't more in the file
        if (!input.eof()) {
          input >> num;
          cout << num << endl;
        }
        // end of main
        return 0;
      }
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS:
    : 100
    : 200

12. Write a program that reads in a text file and prints to the screen
    the number of times the character 'e' shows up

    Inputfile:
    #+begin_src bash :results output
      echo "Erfahrene Enten" > inputTextFile
      cat inputTextFile
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS:
    : Erfahrene Enten

    Solution:
    #+begin_src C++ :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
      #include <iostream>
      #include <fstream>
      using namespace std;

      int main() {
        char character;
        int counter = 0;
        // open input file
        ifstream input;
        input.open("inputTextFile");
        while(!input.eof()) {
          input >> character;
          //cout << character << " ";
          if (character=='e' & !input.eof()) {
            counter++;
          }
        }
        cout << counter << endl;
        return 0;
      }

    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS:
    : 3

    Alternative solution with =get= and exception handling (if file
    cannot be read):
    #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
      /* ------------------------------------------------------------------- */
      /* Read text file and count number of times the character 'e' appears. */
      /* Input: characters in file 'inputTextFile', e.g. "Entenhausen"
         /* Output: The character 'e' appears 2 times in the file.
         /* ------------------------------------------------------------------- */
      #include <iostream>
      #include <fstream>
      using namespace std;

      int main() {
        // open file
        ifstream file("inputTextFile");
        // check if file can be read
        if (!file.is_open()) {
          cerr << "Unable to open file" << endl;
          return 1;
        }
        // get each character and check if it's an 'e'
        char ch;
        int count = 0;
        while (file.get(ch)) {
          if (ch == 'e') {
            count++; // increase counter
          }
        }
        // close the file
        file.close();

        cout << "The character 'e' appears " << count << " times in the file." << endl;

        return 0;
      }
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS:
    : The character 'e' appears 3 times in the file.

** Review questions

1. What is the output of the following code? Copy the code and add comments.
   #+begin_example C++
     int *a, b, c;
     a = &b;
     b = 5;
     c = 1;
     b = b - b;
     c = b * b;
     *a = c - *a;
     a = &c;
     *a = c - 7;
     c = c + c;
     *a = *a + *b;
     c = c + b;
     b = c - 3;
     c = *a - 7;
     cout << *a << endl;
     cout << b << endl;
     cout << c << endl;
   #+end_example

   Solution:
   #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     int *a, b, c; // declare integer pointer, and two integer variables
     a = &b; // a = address of b (pointer to b)
     b = 5; // b = 5 = a
     c = 1; // c = 1
     b = b - b; // b = 5 - 5 = 0
     c = b * b; // c = 0 * 0 = 0
     ,*a = c - *a; // *a = 0 - b = 0 - 0 = 0 (b = 0)
     a = &c; // a = address of c (pointer to c): *a = 0
     ,*a = c - 7; // *a = 0 - 7 = -7 (and c = -7)
     c = c + c; // c = -7 -7 = -14 (*a = -14)
     ,*a = *a + b; // *a = -14 (c = -14)
     c = c + b; // c = -14 + 0 = -14
     b = c - 3; // b = -14 - 3 = -17
     c = *a - 7; // c = -14 -7 = -21
     cout << *a << endl; // -21 (value of c)
     cout << b << endl; // -17
     cout << c << endl; // -21
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : -21
   : -17
   : -21

2. What is the output of the following code: Copy the code and add comments.
   #+begin_example C++
     int a,b,*c;
     a = 7;
     b = 4;
     c = &a;
     a = *c - a;
     *c = *c + 4;
     a = b + a;
     c = &b;
     a = a - b;
     *c = b + a;
     *c = *c - 1;
     a = a * 1;
     a = b - *c;
     a = a - *c;
     cout << a << endl;
     cout << b << endl;
     cout << *c << endl;
   #+end_example

   Solution:
   #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output :exports both :comments both :tangle yes :noweb yes
     int a,b,*c; // declare integer variables a, b, and integer pointer c
     a = 7; // a = 7
     b = 4; // b = 4
     c = &a; // c = address of a (pointer to a)
     a = *c - a; // a = 7 - 7 = 0 (since *c = 7 = a)
     ,*c = *c + 4; // *c = 0 + 4 = 4 (since *c = a = 0)
     a = b + a; // a = 4 + 4 = 8 (a = *c)
     c = &b; // c = address of b (pointer to b)
     a = a - b; // a = 8 - 4 = 4
     ,*c = b + a; // *c = 4 + 4 = 8 (now b = 8)
     ,*c = *c - 1; // *c = 8 - 1 = 7 (= b)
     a = a * 1; // a = 4 * 1 = 4
     a = b - *c; // a = 7 - 7 = 0
     a = a - *c; // a = 0 - 7 = -7
     cout << a << endl; // -7
     cout << b << endl; // 7
     cout << *c << endl; // 7 (value of b)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : -7
   : 7
   : 7
