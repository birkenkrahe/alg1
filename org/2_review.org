* IN PROGRESS Overview

We review C by continuing with derived data types that you should
already know: arrays, pointers, functions. We review by coding and
analyzing code.

*Objectives:*
- ...

Next, we learn some new derived data types, structures, unions and
enums.

* Problem Descriptions and Solution Process

Each problem begins with three components:
1) The problem context as a short description.
2) The problem input in the form of test cases which must be passed.
3) The problem output in the exact form required (with time limit).

Each solution includes:
1) A short description how we tackle the problem.
2) Minimal comments in the source code.
3) Program organization:
   1. Preprocessor directives
   2. Type definitions
   3. Declarations of external variables
   4. Prototypes for functions other than =main=
   5. Definition of =main=
   6. Definitions of other functions
4) Review questions and notes.

* Arrays: Reversing a Series of Numbers

- *Problem:* Prompt the user to enter a series of numbers, then write
  the numbers in reverse order.
