* TODO Exercises: Initializing String Variables

** Exercise 1: Basic Initialization

- Declare a character array called =greeting= with a length of 10 and
  initialize it with the string ="Hello"=. Use =printf= to print the
  string.

  #+begin_src C

  #+end_src

** Exercise 2: Exact Fit without Null Character

- Declare a character array =month= with a length of 5 and initialize it
  with the string ="June"=. Print the string and observe the result.

- Modify the code to add a =\0= at the end of =month= and print it again.

  #+begin_src C

  #+end_src

** Exercise 3: Overfilled Array

- Declare a character array =day= with length 3 and try initializing it
  with the string ="Mon"=. Print the array using =printf=.

  #+begin_src C

  #+end_src

** Exercise 4: Using =sizeof= with Strings
- Declare =char name[] = "Student";=. Print the size of =name= using
  =sizeof= and compare it with the length of the string.

  #+begin_src C

  #+end_src

* TODO Exercises: Character Arrays versus Character Pointers

** Exercise 5: String Array vs. Pointer Modification Attempt
- Declare =char message_a[] = "Welcome";= and =char *message_p =
  "Welcome";=.

- Try modifying the first character of each: =message_a[0] = 'w';= and
  =message_p[0] = 'w';=.

  #+begin_src C

  #+end_src

** Exercise 6: Changing the Pointer Target

- Initialize two character arrays =char date1[] = "June 14";= and =char
  date2[] = "July 15";=.

- Declare a character pointer =char *p= and make it point to
  =date1=. Print the string using =p=, then change =p= to point to =date2= and
  print again.

  #+begin_src C

  #+end_src

** Exercise 7: Pointer Initialization and Dereferencing

- Declare a character array =char city[] = "Paris";= and a character
  pointer =char *ptr=.

- Initialize =ptr= to point to =city= and print the first character of
  =city= by dereferencing =ptr= with =*ptr= and =ptr[0]=.

  #+begin_src C

  #+end_src

** Exercise 8: Uninitialized Pointer Error Simulation

- Declare a character pointer =char *uninitialized_ptr;=. Attempt to
  assign =uninitialized_ptr[0] = 'X';=.

  #+begin_src C

  #+end_src


* TODO Exercises: Writing strings

** Exercise 9: Simple String Output

- *Problem*: Write a program that stores the string ="Learning C is
  fun!"= in a variable and prints it to the console.

- *Solution*:
  #+begin_src C

  #+end_src

** Exercise 10: Partial String Output

- *Problem*: Modify the previous program to only print the first 10
  characters of the string.

- *Solution*:
  #+begin_src C

  #+end_src

** Exercise 11: String Formatting with Field Width
- *Problem*: Use the string ="C programming"= and:
  1. Print only the first 5 characters in a field of width 8,
     right-aligned.
  2. Print only the first 5 characters in a field of width 8,
     left-aligned.
  3. Print a ruler (=|....|....|....|=) to check your results.

- *Solution*:
  #+begin_src C

  #+end_src

** Exercise 12: Safe String Input with fgets

- *Problem*: Write a program that reads a line of text using =fgets= and
  then prints it. Use the =:cmdline < strinput= header argument to
  stream the data to the program.

- String input:
  #+begin_src bash :results output

  #+end_src

- *Solution*:
  #+begin_src C :cmdline < strinput

  #+end_src

* TODO Exercises: Reading strings

** Exercise 13: Printing on new lines

- *Problem*: Write a program that stores ="Hello, C!"= in a string
  variable. Use a loop to print each character in the string on a
  new line.

- *Solution*:

  #+begin_src C

  #+end_src

** Exercise 10: Reading Strings Character-by-Character

- *Problem*: Write a program that stores ="Hello, C!"= in a string
  variable. Use a loop to print each character in the string on a new
  line.

- *Solution*:
  #+begin_src C

  #+end_src

** Exercise 11: Pointer Arithmetic in Strings

- *Problem*: Modify the =count_spaces= function to use pointer arithmetic
  instead of array indexing.
  
- *Solution*:
  #+begin_src C
    #include <stdio.h>

    int count_spaces(const char *s) {
      int count = 0;
      // ...
      return count;
    }

    int main() {
      char str[] = "Can you count spaces?";
      printf("Spaces in \"%s\" = %d\n", str, count_spaces(str));
      return 0;
    }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Spaces in "Can you count spaces?" = 0

** Exercise 12: Exploring scanf and Strings
- *Problem*: Write a program that reads a word using =scanf= and prints
  it. Modify the program to only allow up to 10 characters to be read.

- *Solution*:
  #+begin_src C

  #+end_src

* TODO Exercise: Pointer and string literal argument call

Modify =count_spaces= function call with pointer variable and with string literal.

- Function call with pointer variable:
  #+begin_src C
    int count_spaces(const char *s) // const prevents modification of
    // whatever s points to but not s itself
    {
      int count = 0;
      for ( ; *s != '\0'; s++) // no need for start index counter
        if (*s == ' ')
          count++;
      return count;
    }

    int main(void)
    {

      // str decays to pointer to str[0] upon function call

      return 0;
    }
  #+end_src

- Function call with string literal:
  #+begin_src C
    int count_spaces(const char *s) // const prevents modification of
    // whatever s points to but not s itself
    {
      int count = 0;
      for ( ; *s != '\0'; s++) // no need for start index counter
        if (*s == ' ')
          count++;
      return count;
    }

    int main(void)
    {
      // str decays to pointer to str[0] upon function call

      return 0;
    }
  #+end_src
