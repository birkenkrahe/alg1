* README

- This lecture with practice exercises covers the advanced use of
  pointers, in preparation for understanding linked lists.

- There will be a bonus home assignment to check your understanding.

- There will be a video with an extended example building on the
  extended example from the lecture on strings (task management).

* Advanced use of pointers

- Using /dynamical memory allocation/, a program can obtain blocks of
  memory as needed during execution.

- We'll discuss dynamically allocated strings and arrays with =malloc=
  and their deallocation with =free=.

- These structures can be linked together to form lists, trees, and
  other flexible data structures.

- We introduce /linked lists/, the most fundamental linked data
  structure.

- Advanced pointer use also includes pointers to functions: Some of
  C's library functions expect function pointers as arguments - one of
  these is =qsort=, which can sort any array fast (we won't cover this).

- As a motivation booster, the number of programmers who master these
  concepts is no larger than 10% world-wide. And you can get there in
  a 200-level undergraduate class!

- Differently put, in one of the densest, most complete books on C
  programming, you're now past page 400 (few explorers get that far).

* Dynamic storage allocation

- C data structures are normally fixed in size:

  1. The number of elements of an array is fixed after compilation.

  2. In C99, a VLA length is determined at run time but it remains
     fixed for the array's lifetime.

- This is a problem because we're forced to choose the size when
  writing a program - we cannot change it without rewriting and
  recompiling the code.

* Memory allocation functions

- There are three, all defined in =<stdlib.h>=:

  1. =malloc=, which allocates a memory block without initialization.

  2. =calloc=, which allocates memory and clears it.

  3. =realloc=, which resizes a previously allocated block of memory.

- Of these, =malloc= is most used and most efficient. Check =MALLOC(3)=.

- When we call =malloc= to request memory, the function has no idea what
  type of data we plan to store there - it therefore does not return a
  pointer to an ordinary type (=int= or =char=).

- Instead, the =malloc= returns a value of type =void *=, a generic
  pointer, which is just a memory address, to be specified later.

* Null pointers

- If =malloc= cannot locate a block of memory large enough to satisfy
  our request, it returns a /null pointer/, a pointer to nothing, =NULL=.

- After calling =malloc=, we must test if its =return= value is =NULL=:

  #+begin_example C
    p = malloc(10000); // reserve 10k bytes, store address in pointer p
    if (p == NULL)
      /* allocation failed, take appopriate action like EXIT_FAILURE*/
  #+end_example

- You can also combine these in one statement:

  #+begin_example C
  if ( (p = malloc(10000)) == NULL)
      /* allocation failed, take appopriate action */
  #+end_example

- What is "appropriate action"?

  1. Abort the program.

  2. Issue warning, keep a log, save what can be saved, and continue.

* Dynamically allocated strings with =malloc=

- Strings are stored in character arrays and it can be hard to
  anticipate their length.

- By allocating a string dynamically, we can postpone the decision
  until the program is running.

- The =malloc= function has the following /prototype/:

  #+begin_src C :results none

  #+end_src

- To allocate space for a string of =n= characters:

  #+begin_example C

  #+end_example

- You can also make the /cast/ from =void *= to =char *= explicit:

  #+begin_example C

  #+end_example

- To initialize =p=, you can use =strcpy=:

  #+begin_example C

  #+end_example

- What is =sizeof(p)=? Is that the length of the string stored in =p=?

* Practice: Dynamically Allocating and Managing Strings (v1)

Write a C program that does the following:

1. Prompts the user to enter their name.
2. Dynamically allocates memory to store the name.
3. Copies the entered name into the allocated memory.
4. Prints greeting message using the name stored in memory.
5. Frees the allocated memory before exiting.

Example Output:
#+begin_example
Enter your name: Marcus
Hello, Marcus!
#+end_example

Hints:
- Use =gets= (unsafe) or =fgets= (safe) to get any string (including
  whitespace) instead of =scanf=.
- Use =malloc= to allocate memory for the string.
- Remember to allocate space for the null terminator =\0=.
- Check memory allocation success with =NULL=.
- Use =strcpy= to copy the user input into the allocated memory.
- Use =free= to release the allocated memory.

** Solution

- Sample input:
  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both

  #+end_src

- Code (remove =main= and =includes= templates) v1: with =gets= (unsafe)
  #+begin_src C  :cmdline < nameInput :tangle main.c :main no :includes

  #+end_src

- Version 2: make code safer with =fgets= (see script)

* Practice: Using Command-Line Arguments with Dynamically Allocated Strings (v2)

Write a C program that does the following:

1. Accepts the user's full name (in quotes) as command-line argument.
2. Dynamically allocates memory to store the name.
3. Copies the command-line argument into the allocated memory.
4. Prints a greeting message using the name stored in the dynamically allocated memory.
5. Frees the allocated memory before exiting.

**Example Usage:**
#+begin_example
$ ./main Marcus Birkenkrahe
Hello, Marcus Birkenkrahe!
#+end_example

Hints:
- Use =main(int argc, char *argv[])= to handle command-line arguments.
- =argc= represents the number of arguments passed to the program.
- =argv[1]= holds the first command-line argument after the program name.
- Use =malloc= to allocate memory for the string.
- Remember to allocate space for the null terminator ('=\0=')
- Use =strcpy= to copy the cmd-line argument into the allocated memory.
- Use =free= to release the allocated memory.

** Solution:

- Code without checks if arguments were provided: source code =main.c=
  #+begin_src C :cmdline < name :results none :tangle main.c

  #+end_src

- Test:
  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both

  #+end_src

- Version 2: Code with checks if command-line arguments were provided
  (see script).

* Using dynamic storage allocation in string functions

- You can now write functions that return a pointer to a =new= string
  that didn't exist before the function was called.

- Example: concatenate two strings without changing eigher one. The C
  standard library has =strcat= but it modifies one of them:

  #+begin_src C

  #+end_src

- Why does the following code not work? ("Segmentation fault")
  #+begin_src C :results silent
    char *one = "Hello, ";
    char *two = "world!";

    printf("%s\n",strcat(one,two));
  #+end_src

- The following =concat= function does this:

  1) measure length of the two strings to be concatenated with =strlen=

  2) call =malloc= to allocate the right amount of space

  3) copy first string into new space using =strcpy=

  4) concatenate second string using =strcat=

- Code:

  #+begin_src C :main no

  #+end_src

* Dynamically allocated arrays

- Strings are arrays, and dynamically allocated arrays have the same
  advantages as dynamically allocated strings: You can wait until
  run-time to decide an array's size.

- C lets you allocate space for an array during execution and then
  access the array through a pointer to its first element.

- Sometimes, =calloc= is used instead of =malloc= since it initializes the
  memory that it allocates. =realloc= lets us shrink or grow the array.

* Using =malloc= to allocate storage for an array

- To allocate an array of =n= integers where =n= is to be computed during
  run-time, we

  1) declare an integer pointer variable =int *=

  2) allocate memory with =malloc= using =sizeof(int)=

  3) initialize the array (can use pointer arithmetic)

  4) =free= the array memory when we're done using =free(3)=.

- Code:

  #+begin_src C

  #+end_src

- Sometimes, you'll also see a casting operator =(int *)= before the
  =malloc= function - because it returns a =void *= pointer by
  default. You might see this when code is shared between C and C++.

  #+begin_src C :results silent

  #+end_src

* Safeguarding =malloc= with =fprintf=

- To ensure dynamic memory allocation is successful, it is good
  practice to safeguard against failures using conditional checks.

- The =fprintf= function can be used to display an error message to
  =stderr= (the standard error stream) when =malloc= returns =NULL=,
  preventing undefined behavior in the event of memory allocation
  failure.

  The script contains an example of how to use =fprintf=.

* Deallocating storage with =free=

- =malloc= and the other memory allocation functions obtain memory
  blocks from the /heap/. Calling them too often may exhaust it.

- The program may allocated memory and then lose track of it, wasting
  space:

  #+begin_src C

  #+end_src

* The "dangling pointer" problem

- The call =free(p)= deallocates the memory block that =p= points to, but
  it does not change =p= itself - it's a /dangling pointer/, and we must
  not use it unless it is reinitialized:

  #+begin_src C

  #+end_src

* Practice: Randomly Initialized Dynamic Arrays Using Command-Line Arguments

Write a C program that:
1. Dynamically allocates an array to store =n= integers, where =n= is
   provided as a command-line argument.
2. Initializes the array with random numbers between 1 and 100 using
   the =rand()= function.
3. Computes the sum of all elements in the array using pointer
   arithmetic.
4. Prints the array and the computed sum.
5. Safeguards against memory allocation failure with =fprintf=.
6. Frees the allocated memory after computation.
