- Remember pointers? What they are good for:
  1) Direct access of memory addresses (important for hardware)
  2) Allocation of memory at runtime to handle data structures
  3) Passing arguments by reference to modify vars in calling function
  4) Passing pointers means you don't have to copy large structures
  5) Create complex data structures (linked lists, trees, graphs)
  6) Create memory-efficient programs (important for big data)
  7) Enable polymorphic behaviour in C and C++ (OOP)

- "Polymorphic" ("made of many forms", in Greek) in this context means
  that you allow objects to be treated as instances of their parent
  class even if they belong to a subclass with its own behavior.

- Pointers and arrays are closely related in the C programming
  language. Understanding pointer arithmetic and how arrays are
  accessed through pointers is fundamental for low-level memory
  management and efficient program execution.

- In class, we'll be working with a wiki-type summary and interactive
  exercises. This section is accompanied by one bonus and by one
  mandatory programming assignment, as well as an online test.

- Much of this is based on King, C Programming (2008), chapter 12.

* Pointer Arithmetic

- Pointers can point to array elements:
  1) Define pointer
  2) Point at array element
  3) Store values using pointer

  #+begin_src C
    int a[10] = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};
    int *p;  // * is a declaration symbol here and not a dereferencing operator
    int *q;

    p = &a[0]; // p points to a[0]
    q = &a[9];

    printf("p points at a[%d]\n", *p); // * is a dereferencing operator
    printf("q points at a[%d]\n", *q);

    (*p) = 5;
    printf("a[0] = %d\n", a[0]);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : p points at a[0]
  : q points at a[9]
  : a[0] = 5

  #+attr_html: :width 400px:
  [[../img/ch12_1.png]]

- You can now store a value in =a[0]= by writing =*p = 5=:
  #+attr_html: :width 400px:
  [[../img/ch12_2.png]]

- You can use the pointer to access other array elements: this is
  called /pointer/ or /address arithmetic/ on =p= by

  1) Adding an integer to a pointer

  2) Subtracting an integer from a pointer

  3) Subtracting one pointer from another

  Pointers cannot be multiplied with or divided by one another.

* Adding an Integer to a Pointer

- Adding an integer =j= to a pointer =p= yields a pointer to the element =j=
  places after the element =p= points to: if =p= points to =a[i]=, then =p+j=
  points to =a[i+j]=.

- Code example (illustrated below)
  #+begin_src C
    int a[10] = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};
    int *p, *q, i;

    p = &a[2]; // p points at a[2]
    printf("p points at a[%d]\n", *p);

    q = p + 3; // q points at a[2+3] = a[5]
    printf("q points at a[%d]\n", *q);

    p += 6;  // p points at a[2+6] = a[8]
    printf("p points at a[%d]\n", *p);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : p points at a[2]
  : q points at a[5]
  : p points at a[8]

  #+attr_html: :width 400px:
  [[../img/ch12_3.png]]

* Subtracting an Integer from a Pointer

- If =p= points to =a[i]= then =p - j= points to =a[i-j]=.

  #+begin_src C
    int a[10] = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};
    int *p, *q, i;

    p = &a[8]; // p points at a[8]
    printf("p points at a[%d]\n", *p);

    q = p - 3; // q points at a[8-3] = a[5]
    printf("q points at a[%d]\n", *q);

    p -= 6;  // p points at a[8-6] = a[2]
    printf("p points at a[%d]\n", *p);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : p points at a[8]
  : q points at a[5]
  : p points at a[2]

  #+attr_html: :width 400px:
  [[../img/ch12_4.png]]

* Subtracting one Pointer from Another

- When one pointer is subtracted from one another, the result is the
  distance (in array elements) between the pointers. If =p= points to
  =a[i]= and =q= points to =a[j]=, then =p - q= is equal to =i-j=.

  #+begin_src C
    int a[10], *p, *q, i;

    p = &a[5]; // p points at a[5]
    q = &a[1]; // q points at a[1]

    i = p - q; // i is 4
    i = q - p; // i is -4

    printf("p - q = %d\n", (int)(p - q)); // needs cast to (int)
    printf("q - p = %d\n", (int)(q - p));
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : p - q = 4
  : q - p = -4

  #+attr_html: :width 400px:
  [[../img/ch12_5.png]]

* Comparing pointers

- You can compare pointers if they point to the same array. The
  outcome is determined by the relative positions of the elements in
  the array:

  #+begin_src C :tangle compare_pointers.c
    int a[10], *p, *q, i;

    p = &a[5]; // p points at a[5]
    q = &a[1]; // q points at a[1]

    printf("p < q: %d\n", p < q); // 5 < 1 is FALSE (0)
    printf("p > q: %d\n", p > q); // 5 > 1 is TRUE (1)

    // Show this by printing the addresses
    printf("%d < %d: %d\n", p, q, p < q); 
    printf("%d > %d: %d\n", p, q, p > q);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : p < q: 0
  : p > q: 1
  : -827356428 < -827356444: 0
  : -827356428 > -827356444: 1

* Pointers to compound literals

- Pointers can point to an element within an array created by a
  compound literal.

- Recall that a compound literal is a C99 feature that is used to
  create an array without declaration or name.

- Example:
  #+begin_src C
    int *p = (int []){3, 0, 3, 4, 1}; // p points at first element (3)

    printf("p points at a[0] = %d\n", *p);

    p += 4;
    printf("p points at a[4] = %d\n", *p);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : p points at a[0] = 3
  : p points at a[4] = 1

* Using Pointers for Array Processing

- Using pointer arithmetic, you can visit array elements by increasing
  a pointer variable.

- Example: Sum elements of an array =a=
  #+begin_src C
    #define N 10

    int a[N] = {11,34,82,7,64,98,47,18,79,20};

    int sum_i, sum_p, *p, i;

    sum_i = sum_p = 0;
    // loop with subscripting
    for (i=0; i<N; i++)
      sum_i+=a[i];
    printf("sum = %d\n", sum_i);
    // loop with pointer arithmetic
    for (p = &a[0]; p < &a[N]; p++) { // p++: p = p + 1
      sum += *p;
      printf("iter: %d sum: %d\n", *p, sum);
     }
    printf("Sum of array elements: %d\n", sum);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  #+begin_example
  iter: 11 sum: 11
  iter: 34 sum: 45
  iter: 82 sum: 127
  iter: 7 sum: 134
  iter: 64 sum: 198
  iter: 98 sum: 296
  iter: 47 sum: 343
  iter: 18 sum: 361
  iter: 79 sum: 440
  iter: 20 sum: 460
  Sum of array elements: 460
  #+end_example

- Noteworthy: =p < &a[N]= is allowed for the loop condition even though
  =a[10]= does not exist (the maximum element of =a= is =a[9]=).

- The same result can be achieved with subscripting, of course
  (avoiding pointers) but using pointers can improve performance.

* Combining =*= and =++= Operators

- Can you guess what the pointer equivalent of =a[i++] = j= is?
  #+begin_quote
  - The non-pointer statement assigns =j= to the array element =a[i]= and
    then advances one element

  - Remember =push= and =pop= with =contents[top++]= and =contents[--top]=.

  - If =p= points at =a[i]=, then =*p++= points at =*&a[i++]= or =a[i++]=.  so
    =a[i++]= is equivalent to =*p++ = j=.

  - Because =++= takes precedence over =*=, the compiler sees =*p++= as
    =*(p++)=, and the value of =p++= is =p= (because of the postfix
    operator).
  #+end_quote

  #+begin_src C
    int a[10]={0}, i, j, val, *p;

    i = 1;
    val = -1;
    a[i++] = val;

    i = 6;
    p = &a[6];
    (*p++) = val;  // assign val to *p and then advance to p+1

    printf("0   1  2  3  4  5   6  7  8  9\n");
    for (j=0; j<10; j++)
      printf("%d  ", a[j]);

    printf("\nvalue *p = %d ", *p); // points at a[7]
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 0   1  2  3  4  5   6  7  8  9
  : 0  -1  0  0  0  0  -1  0  0  0  

- Note: Org-mode code blocks need the extra parentheses around =*p++=
  because the leading asterisk is otherwise interpreted

- =*p++= is handy in loops: to sum the elements of an array =a= as before,
  with =for (p = &a[0]; p < &a[N]; p++)=, you can now write
  #+begin_src C
    #define N 10

    int a[N] = {11,34,82,7,64,98,47,18,79,20};
    int sum, *p;

    sum = 0;
    p = &a[0];
    while (p < &a[N])
      sum = sum + (*p++);
    printf("Sum of array elements: %d\n", sum);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Sum of array elements: 460

- Another application is the stack implementation: you can replace the
  variable =top= used to keep track of the top-of-stack position in the
  =contents= array by a pointer variable that points initially to
  =contents[0]=:
  #+begin_example C
    int *top_ptr = &contents[0];
  #+end_example

- How would the =push= and =pop= functions look like? We can now replace
  =contents[top++]= by =*top_ptr++=, and =contents[--top]= by =*--top_ptr=.

- Testing this and updating the other stack functions is a bonus
  exercise.

* Using an Array Name as a Pointer

- The name of an array can be used as a pointer to the first element
  in the array - this simplifies pointer arithmetic:
  #+begin_src C
    int a[10];

    (*a) = 7; // stores 7 in a[0]

    (*(a+1)) = 12; // stores 12 in a[1]
  #+end_src

- Since =a + i= is the same as =&a[i]= and =*(a+i)= is the same as =a[i]=,
  array subscripting can be viewed as a form of pointer arithmetic.

- It is now easier to step through an array using pointers (last line):
  #+begin_src C
    #define N 10
    int a[N] = {[0 ... N-1]=1}, *p; // initialize with a designated initializer
    for (int i=0;i<N;i++) printf("%d ",a[i]); puts("");// regular subscripting
    for (p = &a[0];p<&a[N];p++) printf("%d ",*p); puts("");// pointer subscripting
    for (p = a; p < a + N; p++) printf("%d ",*p); puts("");// pointer subscripting
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
  : 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
  : 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

- You cannot assign the array name a new value but have to copy it to
  a pointer first:
  #+begin_src C
    #define N 10
    int a[N] = {[0 ... N-1]=1}, *p; // initialize with a designated initializer

    p = a;
    while (*p != 0)
      p--;

    printf("%p %d\n", p, *p);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 0x7ffce34d4b04 0

- As an application of array names as pointers, we revisit =reverse.c=:
  #+begin_src C :tangle reverse.c :main no :includes :results none
    /**************************************************************/
    // reverse.c: reverse a series of numbers entered by the user
    // Store numbers as int array with scanf in a for loop
    // Print numbers in reverse order with printf in a for loop
    /**************************************************************/
    #include <stdio.h> // include input/output header file
    #define N 10  // define constant array length with directive

    int main() // main program
    {
      int i;           // declare loop variable
      int a[N] = {0};  // macro definition (uses constant N)
      printf("Enter 10 numbers: "); // ask for input
      for ( i = 0; i < N; i++) { // loop over array (counting up)
        scanf("%d", &a[i]); // get the i-th array element from stdin
        printf("%d ", a[i]); // print the i-th array element to stdout
      }
      puts("");  // add new line
      printf("In reverse order: ");
      for ( i = N-1; i >= 0; i--) { // loop over array (counting down)
        printf("%d ", a[i]);
      }
      puts("");
      return 0; // confirm program ran successfully
    } // end of main program
  #+end_src

- After tangling the file (=C-u C-c C-v t=):
  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
    gcc reverse.c -o rev
    echo 34 82 49 102 2 94 23 11 50 31 | ./rev
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Enter 10 numbers: 34 82 49 102 2 94 23 11 50 31
  : In reverse order: 31 50 11 23 94 2 102 49 82 34

- The program reads 10 numbers, stores them in an array =a= and then
  steps backwards through the same array as it prints the numbers.

- In =reverse2.c=, array subscripting has been replaced with pointer
  arithmetic:
  #+begin_src C :tangle reverse2.c :main no :includes :results none
    /**************************************************************/
    // reverse2.c: reverse a series of numbers entered by the user
    // Store numbers as int array with scanf in a for loop
    // Print numbers in reverse order with printf in a for loop
    // *** This version of the program uses pointer arithmetic ***
    /**************************************************************/
    #include <stdio.h> // include input/output header file
    #define N 10  // define constant array length with directive

    int main() // main program
    {
      int *p;       // declare loop pointer
      int a[N] = {0};  // macro definition (uses constant N)
      p = a;
      printf("Enter 10 numbers: "); // ask for input
      for ( p = a; p < a + N; p++) { // loop over array (counting up)
        scanf("%d", p); // get the i-th array element *(p+i) from stdin
        printf("%d ", *p); // print the i-th array element to stdout
      };
      puts("");  // add new line
      printf("In reverse order: ");
      for ( p = a + N -1; p >= a; p--) { // loop over array (counting down)
        printf("%d ", *p);
      }
      puts("");

      return 0; // confirm program ran successfully
    } // end of main program
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Enter 10 numbers: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

- After tangling the file (=C-u C-c C-v t=):
  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
    gcc reverse2.c -o rev2
    echo 34 82 49 102 2 94 23 11 50 31 | ./rev2
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Enter 10 numbers: 34 82 49 102 2 94 23 11 50 31
  : In reverse order: 31 50 11 23 94 2 102 49 82 34

- Note:
  1. =p < N= is wrong (comparing pointer and integer), but =p < a + N= is
     correct because the compiler sees =p < &a[0+N]=.

  2. =scanf= now takes =p= as second argument instead of =&a[i]=.

  3. When printing in reverse order, =i=N-1= becomes =p=a+N-1=. What the
     compiler sees now, is =p = &a[0+N-1]=.

  4. The end condition when counting down is =p>=a=. What the compiler
     sees is =p>=&a[0]=.

- It might be instructive to step through this program using a
  debugger.

* Array Arguments (Revisited)

- When passed to a function, an array name is always treated as a
  pointer (to its first element) - the array "decays to a pointer".

- Example: =find_largest= returns the largest element in an array of
  integers.
  #+name: find_largest
  #+begin_src C :main no :includes
    #include <stdio.h>
    #define N 5

    int find_largest(int a[], int n);

    int main() {
      // call function and pass array as a compound literal
      printf("%d\n", find_largest( (int []) {5, 6, 100, -3, 0}, 5));

      return 0;
    }

    int find_largest(int a[], int n)
    {
      int i, max = a[0];
      for (i = 1; i < n; i++)
        if (a[i] > max) max = a[i];
      return max;
    }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 100

- The array was passed as a /compound literal/, and only the pointer to
  the first element was passed and assigned to =a= in =find_largest=.

- When an ordinary variable is passed to a function, its value is
  copied and therefore no changes in the function affect the original.

- When an array is used as an argument, it is not protected against
  change since no copy is made of the array itself.
  #+begin_src C
    #define N 5
    // function modifies array
    void store_zeros(int a[], int n)
    {
      int i;
      for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
        a[i] = 0;
    }
    int main(void)
    {
      int b[N]={1,1,1,1,1}, i;
      for (i = 0; i < N; i++) printf("%d ", b[i]);
      store_zeros(b,5);
      puts("");
      for (i = 0; i < N; i++) printf("%d ", b[i]);
      return 0;
    }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 1 1 1 1 1
  : 0 0 0 0 0

- To indicate that an array parameter won't be changed, include =const=:
  #+name: find_largest_const
  #+begin_src C :main no :includes
    #include <stdio.h>
    #define N 5

    int find_largest(const int a[], int n);

    int main() {
      // call function and pass array as a compound literal
      printf("%d\n", find_largest( (int []) {5, 6, 100, -3, 0}, 5));

      return 0;
    }

    int find_largest(const int a[], int n)
    {
      int i, max = a[0];
      for (i = 1; i < n; i++)
        if (a[i] > max) max = a[i];
      return max;
    }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: find_largest_const
  : 100

- There is no time penalty for passing a large array to a function,
  since no copy is made!

- An array parameter can be declared as a pointer - the compiler
  treats them identical.
  #+name: find_largest_ptr
  #+begin_src C :main no :includes
    #include <stdio.h>
    #define N 5

    int find_largest(int *a, int n);

    int main() {
      // call function and pass array as a compound literal
      printf("%d\n", find_largest( (int []) {5, 6, 100, -3, 0}, 5));

      return 0;
    }

    int find_largest(int a[], int n)
    {
      int i, max = a[0];
      for (i = 1; i < n; i++)
        if (a[i] > max) max = a[i];
      return max;
    }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: find_largest_ptr
  : 100

- This is not true for a variable! ~int a[10]~ reserves space for 10
  integers, but ~int *a~ only reserves space for a pointer variable (not
  an array): ~*a = 0;~ will store 0 where ~a~ is pointing, and since we
  don't know where that is, the effect is undefined.

- A function with an array parameter can be passed an array slice, a
  sequence of consecutive elements. For example to find ~find_largest~
  in the elements ~b[5]...b[14]~, we can pass ~b[5]~ and the number 10.
  #+begin_example C
    largest = find_largest(&b[5],10);
  #+end_example

* Using a Pointer as an Array Name

- Since you can use an array name as a pointer, you can also subscript
  a pointer as though it were an array name:
  #+begin_src C
    #define N 10

    int a[N]={[0 ... 9] = 2}, i, sum = 0, *p = a;

    for (i=0;i<N;i++)
      sum+=p[i];

    printf("%d\n",sum);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 20

- The compiler treats =p[i]= as =*(p+i)=. This will be useful when
  dynamically allocating memory (ch 17.3).

- I was surprised when I first saw the declaration + initialization
  =int *p = a= but the statement =p = a=. What's going on?
  #+begin_quote
  - The declaration uses =*= as a type indicator and initializes the
    pointer with the array - now =p= points at =a[0]=.
  - The statement =p = a= with the already declared pointer =p= achieves
    the same but here, =*p = a= would be an error because =*= is the
    indirection operator, and the statement would try to set the value
    that =p= points at equal to the array. The error message: /Assignment
    to ‘int’ from ‘int *’ makes integer from pointer without a cast/.
  #+end_quote

* Processing the Elements of a Multidimensional Array

- C stores two-dimensional arrays in row-major order:
  #+attr_html: :width 400px:
  [[../img/multi.png]]

- If the pointer =p= points at element =[0][0]= of the array, then we can
  visit every array element by incrementing =p=.

- Example: initializing all elements of a two-dimensional array - you
  can do it with nested =for= loops or with a single pointer loop:
  #+begin_src C
    #define NROWS 4
    #define NCOLS 4

    int a[NROWS][NCOLS], i, j, *p;

    // initialize with nested loops

- Treating n-dimensional arrays as one-dimensional gives an efficiency
  advantage, especially with older compilers.

* Processing the Rows of a Multidimensional Array

- To process elements just in one row =i= of a 2D array:
  #+begin_example C
    p = &a[i][0] // pointer p points at first column of i-th row
    p = a[i]; // same! &a[i][0] = &(*(a[i] + 0)) = &*a[i] = a[i]
  #+end_example

- Here, =*(a[i][0]) = *(a[i] + 0) because a[i] = *(a + i)=

- To to clear row =i= of an array =a=:
  #+begin_src C
    #define NROWS 4
    #define NCOLS 4

    int a[NROWS][NCOLS], *p, i = 0; // not setting i: segmentation fault!

    for (p = a[i]; p < a[i] + NCOLS; p++) {
      (*p) = 0;
      printf("%d ", *p);
     }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 0 0 0 0

- Since =a[i]= is a pointer to row =i= of the array =a=, we can pass =a[i]= to
  a function that is expecting a one-dimensional array as its
  argument: any function that is designed to work with 1D arrays will
  also work with a row beloning to a 2D array!

- Example: we can use =find_largest= to determine the largest element in
  row =i= of the two-dimensional array =a=:
  #+name: find_largest_in_row
  #+begin_src C :main no :includes :tangle twodim.c
    #include <stdio.h>

    #define NROWS 4
    #define NCOLS 4

    int find_largest(int a[], int n);
    int find_largest_ptr(int a[], int n);

    int main()
    {
      int a[NROWS][NCOLS] = {
        {1,2,3,4},
        {5,6,7,8},
        {9,10,11,12},
        {13,14,15,16}
      };

      int i = 3; // row index

      printf("%d\n", find_largest(a[i], NCOLS));
      printf("%d\n", find_largest_ptr(a[i], NCOLS));

      return 0;
    }

    int find_largest(int a[], int n)
    {
      int i, max = a[0];
      for (i = 1; i < n; i++)
        if (a[i] > max) max = a[i];
      return max;
    }

    int find_largest_ptr(int a[], int n)
    {
      int i, *p = a, max = *p;
      for (p = a; p < a + n; p++)
        if (*p > max) max = *p;
      return max;
    }

  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: find_largest_in_row
  : 16
  : 16

- Note:
  1) do not replace =n= in the prototype and the function definition by
     =NCOLS=. That will lead to an error because you're trying to type a
     constant - =int NCOL= will become =int 4=.
  2) The code shows the function both with a regular and with a
     pointer loop. Notice that the loop only works on one row.

* Processing the Columns of a Multidimensional Array

- This is not as easy since 2D arrays are stored by row, not
  column. We need to tell the computer to point at =[NCOLS]=
  one-dimensional arrays

- This code clears column =j= of an array =a=:
  #+begin_src C
    #define NROWS 4
    #define NCOLS 4

    int a[NROWS][NCOLS] = {
      {1,2,3,4},
      {5,6,7,8},
      {9,10,11,12},
      {13,14,15,16}
    };
    int (*p)[NCOLS], j=1;

    for (p = a; p < a + NROWS; p++) {
      (*p)[j] = 0;
      printf("%d\n", (*p)[j]);
     }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 0
  : 0
  : 0
  : 0

- Here, =p= is declared to be a pointer to an array of length =NCOLS=
  whose elements are integers. Without the parentheses around =*p= in
  =(*p)[NCOLS]=, the compiler would treat p as an array of =NCOLS=
  pointers instead of a pointer to an array.

- The expression =(*p)[j]=, =(*p)= represents an entire row of =a=, so
  =(*p)[j]= selects the element in column =j= of that row. Again, the
  parentheses are essential because the compiler would interpret =*p[j]=
  as =*(p[j])=

- This code sums up the elements of column =j=:
  #+begin_src C
    #define NROWS 4
    #define NCOLS 4

    int a[NROWS][NCOLS] = {
      {1, 2, 3, 4},
      {5, 6, 7, 8},
      {9, 10, 11, 12},
      {13, 14, 15, 16}
    };
    int (*p)[NCOLS], j = 3, sum = 0;

    for (p = a; p < a + NROWS; p++) {
      sum += (*p)[j];
     }
    printf("%d\n", sum);
  #+end_src

- This code computes the largest element by column.
  #+begin_src C
    #define NROWS 4
    #define NCOLS 4

    int a[NROWS][NCOLS] = {
      {1, 2, 3, 4},
      {5, 6, 7, 8},
      {9, 10, 11, 12},
      {13, 14, 15, 16}
    };

    int (*p)[NCOLS] = a, j = 2, largest = *(*p);
    printf("%d\n",largest); // initial value

    for (p = a; p < a + NROWS; p++)
      if ( (*p)[j] > largest ) largest = (*p)[j];

    printf("%d\n",largest); // largest value in column j
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:

* Using the Name of a Multidimensional Array as a Pointer

- You can use the name of a one-dimensional array as a pointer (to its
  0th element), and you can use the name of any array regardless of
  its dimensions.

- The array =int a[NROWS][NCOLS]= is not a pointer to =a[0][0]= but to
  =a[0]=: when used as a pointer, =a= has type =(int *) [NCOLS]=, that is a
  pointer to an integer array of length =NCOLS=.

- That's why the following loops get the same results:
  #+begin_example C
    // using addresses
    for (p = &a[0]; p < &a[NROWS]; p++)
      (*p)[i] = 0;
    // using array name as pointer
    for (p = a; p < a + NROWS; p++)
      (*p)[i] = 0;
  #+end_example

- That's also why in the code [[initialize_matrix]] below, the function
  =single= (that initializes the matrix =a= with =n = NROWS * NCOLS=
  elements) can be called in either of these three ways:
  #+begin_example C
    single(&a[0][0], n); // address
    single( (int *)a, n); // explicit cast
    single(a[0],n); // implicit cast a[0] = (int *)[NCOLS]
  #+end_example

* Review questions
** What does "pointer arithmetic" mean?
#+begin_quote
It refers to using pointers to access array elements that they're
pointing at. You can add an integer to a pointer, subtract an
integer from a pointer, subtract pointers from one another, and
compare pointers. All of these operations are translated to array
index operations.
#+end_quote

** Give an example for adding an integer to a pointer.
#+begin_src C
  int a[10]={100,101,102,103,104,105,105,800,900,1000}, *p, i;
  p = &a[0]; // p points at a[0] = 100
  i = 4;
  printf("*p = %d, a[%d] = %d\n",*(p+i), i, a[i]);
  printf("p = %p, &a[%d] = %p\n",(p+i), i, &a[i]);
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: *p = 104, a[4] = 104
: p = 0x7fff44a63f80, &a[4] = 0x7fff44a63f80

** Give an example for subtracting an integer from a pointer.
#+begin_src C

  i = 3;
  printf("*p = %d, a[%d] = %d\n",*(p-i), 9-i, a[9-i]);
  printf("p = %p, &a[%d] = %p\n", (p-i), 9-i, &a[9-i]);
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: *p = 105, a[6] = 105
: p = 0x7ffc276bf428, &a[6] = 0x7ffc276bf428

** Give an example for subtracting one pointer from another.
#+begin_src C
  int a[10]={100,101,102,103,104,105,105,800,900,1000}, *p, *q;
  p = &a[9]; // p points at a[9]
  q = &a[3];
  printf("p - q = %ld\n", p-q); // distance between locations as indices
  printf("*p - *q = %d\n", *p-*q); // difference of values
  printf("&a[9] - &a[3] = %ld\n", &a[9] - &a[3]); // distance between addresses
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: p - q = 6
: *p - *q = 897
: &a[9] - &a[3] = 6

** If =p = &a[3]=, what is =p+=3= ?
#+begin_quote
If =p= points at the array element =a[3]=, then =p+=3= (or =p = p + 3=)
points at the array element =a[3+3] = a[6]=.
#+end_quote

** Give an example for comparing two pointers
#+begin_src C
  int a[10]={100,101,102,103,104,105,105,800,900,1000}, *p, *q;
  p = &a[9]; // p points at a[9]
  q = &a[3]; // q points at a[3]
  printf("p == q : %d\n", p==q);
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: p == q : 0

** Difference between pointers
A pointer =p= points at =a[9] = 100=, and another pointer =q= points at
=a[6] = 25=. What is the difference between =p - q= and =*p - *q= and
what will be the output of these operations?
#+begin_quote
With =p - q=, we subtract one pointer from one another, which is
computed as their distance in array elements, so =9 - 6 = 3=.

With =*p - *q=, we subtract the values of the variables that the
pointers point at, or =100 - 25 = 75=.
#+end_quote
#+begin_src C
  int a[10]={[6]=25,[9]=100}, *p = &a[9], *q = &a[6];
  printf("p - q: %d\n", (int)(p - q));

** Summing one-dimensional array using a pointer
Sum an array =a= with the elements =100, 200, 300, 400, 500= using a
pointer: use a =for= loop first, and a =while= loop next.
#+begin_src C
  int a[5] = {100, 200, 300, 400, 500}, sum, *p, *q;
  sum=0;

** Initialize matrix with random numbers

- To initialize a 4x4 matrix with random integers, you can use the
  =stdlib::rand= function. To ensure different random numbers on each
  execution, seed the random number generator with =srand= and
  =time(NULL)=.

- The code initializes the matrix using a function =init_rand=. In the
  function, array subscripting is used. The =print_mat= function prints
  the resulting matrix:
  #+begin_src C :main no :includes
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <time.h>

    #define NROWS 4
    #define NCOLS 4

    void init_rand(int *a, int n); // initialize with random integers
    void print_mat(const int a[NROWS][NCOLS]); // print matrix

    int main (void)
    {
      int a[NROWS][NCOLS]; // un-initialized matrix
      int n = NROWS * NCOLS;

      init_rand((int *)a, n);
      print_mat(a);

      return 0;
    }

    void init_rand(int *a, int n)
    {
      srand(time(NULL)); // seed random number generator
      int *p = a;

* Questions & Answers

1. Does =j= in =p + j= add =j= to the address stored in the pointer =p=?
   #+begin_quote
   No - what is added depends on the type of pointer. if =p= is of type
   =int *=, =p + j= adds =4 * j= to =p= because =int= values are stored using 4
   bytes.
   #+end_quote
2. What is better, pointer arithmetics or array subscripting?
   #+begin_quote
   Depends on the compiler.
   #+end_quote
3. Is =i[a]= the same as =a[i]=?
   #+begin_quote
   Yes! =i[a]= is seen as =*(i + a) = *(a + i) = a[i]= because pointer
   addition is commutative.
   #+end_quote
4. If =*a= and =a[]= are equivalent as function parameters, which is
   better?
   #+begin_quote
   Style issue: if you do pointer arithmetic, the first indicates
   that, and if you do array subscripting, the second, but =*a= is much
   more common.
   #+end_quote
5. Are arrays and pointers interchangeable?
   #+begin_quote
   No. array parameters are interchangeable with pointer parameters
   but array variables are not the same as pointer variables. The name
   of an array is not technically a pointer but is cast to a pointer
   when necessary. Also, =sizeof(a)= is the byte-size of an array =a=, but
   if =p= is a pointer variable, =sizeof(p)= is the byte-size required to
   store a pointer (not the variable).
   #+end_quote
6. If =a= is a two-dimensional array, why can we pass =a[0]= but not =a=
   itself to =find_largest= since they both point to the beginning of
   the array?
   #+begin_quote
   Because =a= has the wrong type: as an argument, =a= decays to a pointer
   to the array, but =find_largest(int *a, int n)= expects a pointer to
   an integer, namely the first element of =a=. However, =a[0]= has type
   =int *=, so it is an acceptable argument for =find_largest=.

   2. What is the value of =*(q-3)=?
   3. What is the value of =q-p=?
   4. Is the condition =p < q= true or false?
   5. Is the condition =*p < *q= true or false?

2) What will be the contents of the =a= array after the following statements are executed?
   #+begin_src C
     #define N 10

     int a[N] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10};
     int* p = &a[0];
     int* q = &a[N-1];
     int temp;

     while (p < q) {
       temp = *p;
       (*p++) = *q;
       (*q--) = temp;
      }
   #+end_src

3) Rewrite the following function to use pointer arithmetic instead of
   array subscripting. In other words: eliminate the variable =i= and
   all uses of the =[]= operator. Make as few changes as possible.

   #+begin_src C
     int sum_array(const int a[], int n)
     {
       int i, sum;

       sum = 0;
       for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
         sum += a[i];
       return sum;
     }
   #+end_src

4) Rewrite the following function to use pointer arithmetic instead of
   array subscripting. In other words: eliminate the variable =i= and
   all uses of the =[]= operator. Make as few changes as possible.

   #+begin_src C
     void store_zeros(int a[], int n)
     {
       int i;
       for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
         a[i] = 0;
     }
   #+end_src

5) Update the stack program with pointers to arrays.

6) Write and test the following function:
   #+begin_src C :results none
     double inner_product(const double *a, const double *b, int n);
   #+end_src

   - =a= and =b= are both pinters to arrays of length =n=.
   - The function should return a[0] * b[0] + a[1] * b[1] + ... +
     a[n-1] * b[n-1].
   - Use pointer arithmeic - not subacripting - to visit array
     elements.

* Programming Projects

I will be sharing sample solutions to these projects after the
submission deadline.

1) Write a program that reads a message, and then prints the reversal
   of the message. Sample input/output:
   #+begin_example
   Enter a message: Don't get mad, get even.
   Reversal is: .neve teg ,dam teg t'noD
   #+end_example

   /Hint:/ Read the message one character at a time using =getchar=, and
   store the characters in an array. Stop reading when the array is
   full or the character read is '\n'.

2) Revise the message reversal program (1) to use a pointer instead of an
   integer to keep track of the current position in the array.

3) Write a program that reads a message, then checks whether it's a
   /palindrome/ (the letters in the message are the same from left to
   right as from right to left):
   #+begin_example
   Enter a message: He lived as a devil, eh?
   Palindrome:

   Enter a message: Madam, I am Adam
   Not a palindrome
   #+end_example

   /Hint:/ Ignore all characters that aren't letters. Use integer
   variables to keep track of positions in the array.

4) Revise the palindrome finding program (3) to use pointers instead
   of integers to keep track of positions in the array.

5) Simplify the program (2) by taking advantage of the fact that an
   array name can be used as a pointer.

6) Simplify the program (4) by taking advantage of the fact that an
   array name can be used as a pointer.
