* Overview

We review C by continuing with derived data types that you should
already know: arrays, pointers, functions. We review by coding and
analyzing code.

In this section, we focus on one-dimensional array data
structures. Multi-dimensional arrays are less important in C because
/arrays of pointers/ are a more flexible way to store multi-dimensional
data.

*Objectives:*
- Tackling problems, solutions, and coding rules
- Different ways of developing and running code
- One-dimensional arrays, =for= loops, =scanf= and =printf=
- Use of macros and =sizeof= to set/read array lengths
- Variable-sized arrays (new!) and new basic data types
- Application: Reversing series of numbers
- Application: Checking numbers for repeated digits
- Code along and solve different exercises
- Review questions, glossary, and summary

*Code along:*
1. Open Emacs from the command line with =emacs &=
2. Create an Org-mode file with =C-x C-f 2_review.org=
3. Create a C code chunk with =<s <TAB> C=
4. Add header arguments: ~:main yes :includes <stdio.h> :results output~
5. Write and run a "hello world" test program: =puts("hello world");=
6. If any of these steps don't work for you, let me know!

* Problem Descriptions, Solution Process, and Coding Rules

Each problem begins with three components:
1) The problem context as a short description including potential
   constraints.
2) The problem input in the form of test cases which must be passed.
3) The problem output in the exact form required (optionally with time
   limit[fn:1]).

Each solution includes:
1) A short description how we tackle the problem.
2) Minimal comments in the source code.
3) Functions should be accompanied by a short summary at the top:
   - Name and purpose of the function
   - Return type and parameters
   - Anything noteworthy (for example, edge cases, or ways to break
     the code, or version dependencies)
4) Program organization:
   1. Preprocessor directives
   2. Type definitions
   3. Declarations of external variables
   4. Prototypes for functions other than =main=
   5. Definition of =main=
   6. Definitions of other functions
5) Review (not in the code blocks):
   - Anything you learnt that you may have forgotten
   - Additional code snippets for illustration
   - Open questions
   - Short summary and/or glossary of terms/commands
   - Edge cases (special situations or values)

Coding rules:
1) You should always write your own code (not just copy and paste)
   though you may use secondary sources to help you.
2) You should stay away from using AI for code generation, debugging,
   etc. until you've spent an appropriate length of time trying to
   crack a problem yourself[fn:2].
3) You should be able to explain every part of your code.

* Arrays: Reversing a Series of Numbers

- *Problem:* Prompt the user to enter a series of numbers, then write
  the numbers in reverse order. Store the numbers in an array and use
  a preprocessing directive to set the size of the array. In the =main=
  function, initialize the array's elements to zero.

- *Input* and *Output*:
  #+begin_example
  Enter 10 numbers: 34 82 49 102 2 94 23 11 50 31
  In reverse order: 31 50 11 23 94 2 102 49 82 34
  #+end_example

- Ask yourself if you could write this program right away or not!
  Whatever the answer, let's do it together from scratch.

* Solution

- *Strategy:* The numbers are stored in an array of N = 10 elements. N
  is defined at the start with =#define=. The array is initialized with
  zeros. The numbers are retrieved from standard input with =scanf=
  counting up with a =for= loop, and printed in reverse order with
  =printf= counting down with a =for= loop.

- *Program* =reverse.c=:
  #+begin_src C :tangle reverse.c :main no :includes :cmdline < input
    /**************************************************************/
    // reverse.c: reverse a series of numbers entered by the user
    // Store numbers as int array with scanf in a for loop
    // Print numbers in reverse order with printf in a for loop
    /**************************************************************/
    #include <stdio.h> // include input/output header file
    #define N 10  // define constant array length with directive

    int main() // main program
    {
      int i;           // declare loop variable
      int a[N] = {0};  // macro definition (uses constant N)
      printf("Enter 10 numbers: "); // ask for input
      for ( i = 0; i < N; i++) { // loop over array (counting up)
        scanf("%d", &a[i]); // get the i-th array element from stdin
        printf("%d ", a[i]); // print the i-th array element to stdout
      }
      puts("");  // add new line
      printf("In reverse order: ");
      for ( i = N-1; i >= 0; i--) { // loop over array (counting down)
        printf("%d ", a[i]);
      }
      puts("");
      return 0; // confirm program ran successfully
    } // end of main program
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Enter 10 numbers: 34 82 49 102 2 94 23 11 50 31
  : In reverse order: 31 50 11 23 94 2 102 49 82 34

- To compile and run this program, you have three options[fn:3]:
  1. Add the header argument =:cmdline < input= where =input= is a text
     file containing the test input data. Then run the code block with
     =C-c C-c=. You can create an input file in a shell code block.
  2. Tangle the source code for compilation, debugging and execution
     on the command-line, add the header argument =:tangle reverse.c=,
     tangle with =C-u C-c C-v t= and run it on the command-line shell
     with the chain command: =gcc reverse.c -o rev && ./rev=.
  3. You can also tangle the file as ~reverse.c~ (=C-u C-c C-v t=) and run
     it in a shell code block with the test input:
     #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
       gcc reverse.c -o rev
       echo 34 82 49 102 2 94 23 11 50 31 | ./rev
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : Enter 10 numbers: 34 82 49 102 2 94 23 11 50 31
     : In reverse order: 31 50 11 23 94 2 102 49 82 34

     Let's see how this works:
     1) =gcc reverse.c -o rev= compiles the file and creates an output
        file called =rev=
     2) =echo= prints its arguments (the test series) to stdout
     3) The pipe symbol =|= takes the output on its left and serves it
        as stdin on the right.
     4) =./rev= receives the input from the left and runs with it.
     5) The =./= is necessary for the shell to find the executable file
        =rev= in the current directory.

* Notes

1. Is the program proofed against wrong input? Try to break it using
   the command-line executable entering characters or words instead,
   or leave out numbers.
2. You can use /variable-length arrays/ if you don't want to fix the
   length of the array - but you cannot initialize it (since the
   length of the array is not known at compile-time):
   #+begin_src C :tangle reverse2.c :main yes :includes <stdio.h> :results none :exports both
     int i, n;
     printf("How many numbers do you want to reverse: ");
     scanf("%d", &n);
     int a[n];
     printf("Enter %d numbers: ", n);
     for ( i = 0; i < n; i++) {
       scanf("%d", &a[i]);
      }; puts("");
     printf("In reverse order: ");
     for ( i = n-1; i >= 0; i--) {
       printf("%d ", a[i]);
      }; puts("");
   #+end_src

   Tangle the source file =reverse2.c=, and on the command-line, run:
   #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
     gcc reverse2.c -o rev2
     echo 4 5 4 3 2 | ./rev2  # output: 2 3 4 5
   #+end_src
3. We can compute the length of an array =a= using the =sizeof=
   operator, which is useful if we don't know the length[fn:4].
   #+begin_src C :main no
     #define N 10
     #define SIZE (int)(sizeof(a)/sizeof(a[0]))

     int main (void)
     {
       int i;
       int a[N];
       printf("SIZE = %d\n", SIZE);
       for (i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
         a[i] = i+1;
         printf("%d ", a[i]);
       }
       return 0;
     }
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : SIZE = 10
   : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

4. Macros can also have parameters. Here are two examples:
   #+begin_src C
     #define MAX(x,y) ((x)>(y) ? (x):(y))
     #define IS_EVEN(n) ((n)%2==0)

     printf("Max value: %d\n", MAX(100,200)); // use parametrized macro
     printf("Is 100 even? %d\n", IS_EVEN(100)); // use parametrized macro
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Max value: 200
   : Is 100 even? 1

   In the definition of =MAX=, =x > y ? x : y= is a short version of
   =if...else=:
   #+begin_example C
   if (x > y)
      x
   else
      y
   #+end_example

   You can also use macros to create aliases for commands you're
   tired of typing, like =printf("%d\n",i);=
   #+begin_src C
     #define PRINT_INT(n) printf("%d\n",n);

     int i = 200, j = 100;
     PRINT_INT(i/j);
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 2

* Arrays: Checking a Number for Repeated Digits

- *Problem:* Checks whether any of the digits in a number appear more
  than once. After the user enters a number, the program prints either
  =Repeated digit= or =No repeated digit=:

- *Input* and *Output*:
  #+begin_example
  Enter a number: 28212
  Repeated digit
  #+end_example

- Ask yourself if you could write this program right away or not!
  Whatever the answer, let's do it together from scratch.

* Solution

- *Strategy*: The program uses an array of Boolean values =digits_seen= to
  keep track of which digits 0-9 xappear in a number. Initially, every
  element of the array is =false=. When given a number =n=, the program
  examines its digits one at a time, storing each into the =digit=
  variable, and then using it as an index into =digit_seen=. if
  =digit_seen[digit]= is =true=, then =digit= appears at least twice in
  =n=. If =digit_seen[digit]= is =false=, then =digit= has not been seen
  before, so the program sets =digit_seen[digit= to =true= and keeps
  going.

- *Program* =repdigit.c=:
  #+begin_src C :tangle repdigit.c :main no :includes :results none :exports both
    /*********************************************************/
    // repdigit.c: checks numbers for repeated digits.
    // Input: number with (without) repeated digits.
    // Output: Print "Repeated digit" or "No repeated digit."
    /*********************************************************/
    #include <stdbool.h> // defines `bool` type
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(void)
    {
      // variable declarations and initialization
      bool digit_seen[10] = {false}; // initialized to zeros = false
      int digit;
      unsigned long int n; // an unsigned long integer type

      // getting user input
      printf("Enter a number: ");
      scanf("%lu", &n);
      puts("");

      // scan input number digit by digit
      while (n > 0) { // loop while n positive
        digit = n % 10; // example output: 28212 % 10 = 2
        if (digit_seen[digit]) // if true then digit repeats
          break; // leave loop
        digit_seen[digit] = true;
        n /= 10; // example output: (int) (28212/10) = (int) 2821.2 = 2821
      } // finishes when (int) single digit / 10 = 0

      // print result
      if (n > 0) // found repeat digit before scanning whole number
        printf("Repeated digit\n");
      else  // n = 0 means scanning finished = all digits seen
        printf("No repeated digit\n");

      return 0;
    }
  #+end_src

- Testing:
  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
    gcc repdigit.c -o rep
    echo 1987654321 | ./rep
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Enter a number:
  : Repeated digit

* Notes

1. Make sure you understand the algorithm:
   1) =digit_seen= is a Boolean vector of 10 values initialized to be
      =false= when none of the digits of =n= have been visited yet.
   2) The first =digit= is =n % 10=, that is the remainder of dividing =n=
      by 10. For example for 28212 = 2821 * 10 + 2, 28212 % 10 = 2.
   3) The array element corresponding to =digit = 2= is
      =digit_seen[digit] = digit_seen[2]=. It is 0 (=false=) if the
      digit has not been seen yet, and it is 1 (=true=) if it has been
      seen.
   4) In the latter case (1), the =break= command leads out of the
      =while= loop, because the answer "Are there any repeated digits"
      has been answered.
   5) In the former case (0), =digit_seen[true]= is now set to 1
      (because the digit has been seen), and we move on to the next
      digit: =n / 10= removes the last digit, e.g. =28212 / 10 = 2821.2=
      but =int(2821.2) = 2821=, and the loop starts over for the next
      digit.
   6) If the loop was left early because a repeated digit was found,
      =n > 0=, and ="Repeated digit"= is printed.
   7) If the loop ran through all digits, no repeated digits were
      found, and =n=0= because the last digit divided by 10 is smaller
      than 10, hence its integer part is 0, and =No repeated digit= is
      printed.

2. You don't need to load =<stdbool.h>=, you can also =#define= Boolean
   values and use C's =typedef= keyword to create a synonym for
   previously defined types:
   #+begin_src C :results none
     #define true 1
     #define false 0
     typedef int bool;
   #+end_src
3. C has a number of different =int= types. On a 64-bit machine,
   =unsigned long int= can hold positive whole numbers up to
   $18,446,744,073,709,551,615$. Do you know why that is?
   #+begin_quote
   The largest value is 2^64-1: 64 bits (or 8 words/bytes of 8 bit
   length) can be used to represent a value in binary number 0,1.

   For example, with 3 bits you can represent 2^3=8 values ranging
   from (000) to (111). Likewise, for an n-bit unsigned integer, the
   values range from 0 to 2^n-1. For n=64 that's the number given.

   Can you guess what the range of values will be for =long int=
   (which allows positive and negative integers)?[fn:5]
   #+end_quote
   #+begin_src C :main no
     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <limits.h> // contains definition of ULONG_MAX

     int main() {
       unsigned long int max_value = ULONG_MAX; // max value for unsigned
       // long int
       printf("The largest value for unsigned long int is: %lu\n", max_value);
       return 0;
     }
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : The largest value for unsigned long int is: 18446744073709551615
4. To capture =unsigned long int= numbers, =scanf= requires the =%lu=
   format specification.

* Review questions

1. What constitutes a problem?
   #+begin_quote
   1) Problem context description with constraints.
   2) Input in the form of test cases that must be passed.
   3) Output in exact format with time limit (optional)
   #+end_quote

2. What does a solution include:
   #+begin_quote
   1) A solution strategy describing how you tackled the problem.
   2) Code comments, program and function headers.
   3) Standard program organization.
   4) Solution review with a discussion of edge cases.
   #+end_quote

3. What are the coding rules?
   #+begin_quote
   1) Write code yourself (minimize AI assistance)
   2) Give yourself time to understand and solve a problem.
   3) Be able to explain every part of your code.
   #+end_quote

4. What's a "macro" definition?
   #+begin_quote
   A macro is a directive for the preprocessor to define a constant or
   a name, e.g. =#define PI 3.14=, which is replaced everywhere in the
   code. There are also /parametrized/ or /function-like/ macros like
   =#define PRINT_INT(n) print("%d\n",n)=.
   #+end_quote

5. How can you run a C program in an Org-mode code block (provided the
   program compiles) if the program requires you to give one character
   as input?
   #+begin_quote
   Tangle the file with a header argument =:tangle main.c= and the
   keyboard commands =C-u C-c C-v t=; then create a shell (=bash=) code
   block. In this code block, compile the file and run it by piping
   the input to the executable, which must be called with the relative
   path:
   #+end_quote
   #+begin_example
      gcc main.c -o main
      echo 'a' | ./main
   #+end_example

6. What is a variable-length array? What are the constraints on a VLA?
   #+begin_quote
   A VLA is an array whose memory (aka length) is computed and
   allocated at runtime - for example, you can prompt the user for
   it. The primary restriction is that they cannot be
   initialized. Also, they can't have =static= storage duration.
   #+end_quote

7. What does the =(int)= do in the following preprocessor directive for
   an array =a=, and what is its output?
   #+begin_example C
     #define SIZE (int)(sizeof(a)/sizeof(a[0]))
   #+end_example
   #+begin_quote
   The directive defines =SIZE= so that wherever the compiler finds
   =SIZE=, it is replaced by =(int)(sizeof(a)/sizeof(a[0]))=. In this
   expression, the length of an array =a= is computed, and the result is
   converted into a (signed) integer because =sizeof= returns an
   =unsigned int=, to avoid compiler warnings.

   Another question might be: what if I change the name of the array
   from =b= to =a=? Then the macro does no longer apply and must be
   changed, or a parametrized macro has to be used: =#define
   SIZE(array) (int)(sizeof(a)/sizeof(a[0]))= which works with any
   array name.
   #+end_quote

* Exercises

Submit your solution as an Org-mode file. The code should pass the
test case, and the required output should be part of the Org-mode
file. Since user input is required, compile and run the file in a =bash=
code block.

1. Modify the =repdigit.c= program, which checked a number for repeated
   digits so that it shows which digits (if any) were repeated.

   Sample input and output:
   #+begin_example
   Enter a number: 939577
   Repeated digit(s): 7 9
   #+end_example
p
2. Modify the =repdigit.c= program, which checked a number for repeated
   digits so that it prints a table showing how many times each digit
   appears in the number:

   Sample input and output:
   #+begin_example
   Enter a number: 41271092
   Digit:        0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
   Occurrences:  1  2  2  0  1  0  0  1  0  1
   #+end_example

3. Modify the =repdigit.c= program, which checked a number for repeated
   digits so that the user can enter more than one number to be tested
   for repeated digits. The program should terminate when the user
   enters a number that's less than or equal to 0.

* Summary

- Coding rules focus on understanding code, function summaries, and robustness.
- Proper program organization includes clear structure and minimal comments.
- The use of macros and =sizeof= ensures flexible and maintainable code.
- Using =sizeof= dynamically determines array size, enhancing robustness.
- Variable-sized arrays allow more flexible dynamic memory allocation.
- Besides =int= there are other data types like =unsigned long int=.
- Run Emacs code blocks in =bash= code blocks in the same Org-mode file.

[fn:1]"Time limit" is important if we're looking for the most
efficient code, which depends on the size of the data and the exact
use case, and is highly influenced by the chosen data structures.

[fn:2]An "appropriate amount of time trying to solve a problem" is
very personal - if you really want to learn this stuff, you need to
spend time mulling things over, perhaps for hours or even days. This
usually implies developing strategies for finding and absorbing
technical information - e.g. function or compiler documentation.

[fn:3]If this was R, Julia or Python (interpreted rather than compiled
languages), you'd have another open, namely opening the source file in
a dedicated buffer with =C-c '= and then running all or part of it in
the console (the R, Julia or Python shell), and returning to Org-mode
with =C-c C-k=.

[fn:4] =sizeof(a)= returns the size of =a= in bytes as an unsigned =int=. If
you divide by the byte-size of a single element, you get the number of
elements. We use =(int)= to cast the unsigned =int= of the =sizeof= result,
to avoid compiler warnings.

[fn:5]The range of values for signed long integers is (-2^63-1,2^63-1)
because one bit is lost for the sign, and there are now twice as many
numbers, so the maximum value on a 64-bit machine is (2^63-1)/2 or
4,611,686,018,427,387,904.
