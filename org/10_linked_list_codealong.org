* README

- This lecture with practice exercises contains an introduction to the
  /linked list/ data structure.

- Covered are only:
  1. Definition and use of linked lists
  2. Declaration and initialization of a list
  3. Selecting list member
  4. Inserting a node at the beginning of a linked list

- Not covered:
  1. Searching in a linked list
  2. Deleting a node from a linked list
  3. Doubly linked lists (pointers go both directions)

- There will be a bonus home assignment to check your understanding.

- There will be a video with an extended example building on the
  extended example from the lecture on structures (parts database).

* Linked lists

- A *linked list* consists of a chain of structures called *nodes*. Each
  node contains a pointer to the next node in the chain. The last node
  contains a null pointer:

- A linked list is more flexible than an array to store a collection
  of data items: Nodes can easily be inserted and deleted to grow and
  shrink the list.

- Arrays have "random access": Any of its elements can be accessed in
  the same amount of time using array index subscripting or pointer
  arithmetic.

- Accessing a node in a linked list is fast if the node is close to
  the beginning of the list, and slow if it's near the end.

- A list is an ADT, an Abstract Data Type: We need to define common
  operations on linked lists: inserting a node at the beginning of the
  list, searching for a node, and deleting a node.

* Declaring a Node Type

- We need a structure that represents a single node in a linked list.

- Example: A simple =node= structure with one integer member and a
  pointer member =next= to the next =node=.
  #+name: start_node
  #+begin_src C :results none :main no
    
  #+end_src

- =node= is self-referential because it contains a =node= structure.

- The tag =node= is not special or reserved, it could be any name.

- Normally, you can create a named structure either with a name tag
  like here, or with a =typedef= name. When a structure is
  self-referential, with a member that points to the same type of
  structure, you must use a structure tag.

- Exemplary use of =node=: This program declares a =node= called
  =first=. Setting it to =NULL= means that the list is initially empty.

  #+begin_src C :results none :tangle node.c
    <<start_node>> // node with one integer member `value`

    
  #+end_src

- There is nothing to see here: =first= does not point to a valid memory
  location, and attempting to access =first->value= results in undefined
  behavior.

* Creating a Node

- Constructing a list means creating nodes one by one:

  1) Allocate memory for a new node.

  2) Store data in the node.

  3) Insert the node into the list.

- Code:
  #+name: insert_new_node
  #+begin_src C :results none
    <<start_node>>

      // allocate memory for `new_node`


    // store data in the `value` member of `new_node`

  #+end_src

- After the first command, =new_node= now points to a block of memory
  just large enough to hold a =node= structure with its members.

  #+attr_html: :width 600px:
  [[../img/new_node.png]]

- After the second command, dereferencing =new_node= allows us to access
  its =value= member.

  #+attr_html: :width 600px:
  [[../img/new_node2.png]]

- We can now print the =value= of the =new_node=:
  #+begin_src C
    <<insert_new_node>>

  #+end_src

- The command must be formatted =(*new_node).value = 10;= rather than
  =*new_node.value = 10;= because the dot-operator otherwise takes
  precedence over the indirection operator.

* The right arrow selection operator =->=

- Accessing a member of a structure using a pointer is so common that
  C provides a special operator for it, the "right arrow selection" =->=

- Using the arrow operator instead of indirection + selection with
  =(*new_node).value=:
  #+begin_src C
    <<insert_new_node>>

  #+end_src

- The =->= operator produces an /lvalue/, which is why it can be used in
  the =printf= call or in an assignment with ===.

- You can use =->= for all members of a structure, and you don't have to
  remember which ones are pointers. This is especially useful in
  linked lists with pointers like =*next= to structures that contain
  other pointers.

* Practice: Input with right arrow selection using =scanf=

- Input the =value= 12 using =scanf=.

- Solution (with the structure definition)

  1) Generate an input file:

     #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
       echo 12 > nodeInput
       cat nodeInput
     #+end_src

  2) Using the input file
     #+begin_src C :cmdline < nodeInput
       // structure definition

       // new node definition

       // get input for new_node->value

       // print output

     #+end_src

- Notice that =scanf= requires the /address-of/ =new_node->value= even
  though =new_node= is a pointer. But =new_node->value= is an =int= so we
  need to convert it to an address for =scanf=.

* Practice: Input with right arrow selection using =main(int argc,char **argv)=

- Create another solution with a complete (not =void=) =main= function:

  1) Tangle the file =newNode.c=

  2) Test it on the command-line (in a =bash= block)

  #+begin_src C :main no :return none :tangle newNode.c
    // declare structure

    // main program

  #+end_src


  Testing it with a little more =bash= glizz:
  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
    if [ -e "./newNode.c" ]; then
        gcc newNode.c -o newNode
        ./newNode
        ./newNode 12
    else
        echo "File does not exist"
    fi
  #+end_src

* Inserting a Node at the Beginning of a Linked List

- You can add nodes at any point in the list: At the beginning, at the
  end, or anywhere in the middle. Adding a new element at the
  beginning is the easiest place to do this.

- It takes two statements to insert the node into the list:

  1) Make the new node's =next= member point to the node that was
     previously at the beginning of the list: =new_node->next = first;=

  2) Make the =first= node point to the new node: =first = new_node;=

- Illustration with a little more detail:

  1. Create a first (=NULL=) pointer and a =new_node=, then make a =node=
     list item with =data= and =next= members:

     #+attr_html: :width 600px:
     [[../img/linkedList1.png]]

  2. Point =first= pointer at the first list item. Now both =first= and
     =new_node= point at the same item. Then create a second =node=:

     #+attr_html: :width 600px:
     [[../img/linkedList2.png]]

  3. Create a second list item, make its =next= member point at the
     first list item, and then point =first= at the new item.

     #+attr_html: :width 600px:
     [[../img/linkedList3.png]]

- These statements work even if the list is empty.

- Example code:
  #+name: two_member_list
  #+begin_src C :results none
    // declare structure

    // declare two pointers

    // first list item

    // second list item

  #+end_src

- Print the list so far:
  #+begin_src C
    <<two_member_list>>

    // print the list so far

  #+end_src

* Practice: Modify the code to add a third list member

Add the code chunk for two list members, then:
1) Create a new node.
2) Store 30 in the new node.
3) Point =next= at the previously first member.
4) Point =first= at the new member.
5) Print the list so far.

#+begin_src C
  <<two_member_list>>

    // third list item
  new_node = malloc(sizeof(struct node)); // #1
  new_node->data = 30; // #2
  new_node->next = first; // #3
  first = new_node;

  struct node *item = first; // start at the beginning
  while (item != NULL) {
    printf("item is at %p; next is at %p; data is %d\n",
         item, item->next, item->data);
    item = item->next;
   }
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: item is at 0x5b09bddf22e0; next is at 0x5b09bddf22c0; data is 30
: item is at 0x5b09bddf22c0; next is at 0x5b09bddf22a0; data is 20
: item is at 0x5b09bddf22a0; next is at (nil); data is 10

* Practice: Print list with a function =print_list=

- Write a function =print_list= to print the list.

  #+begin_src C :main no
    struct node {
      int data;
      struct node *next;
    };

    // print list
    // return: nothing
    // params: pointer to list node structure
    void print_list(struct node *list);

    int main(void)
    {

      // declare two pointers
      struct node *first = NULL;
      struct node *new_node;

      // first list item
      new_node = malloc(sizeof(struct node));
      new_node->data = 10;
      new_node->next = first;
      first = new_node;

      // second list item
      new_node = malloc(sizeof(struct node));
      new_node->data = 20;
      new_node->next = first;
      first = new_node;

      print_list(first);
      return 0;
    }

    void print_list(struct node *first)
    {
      struct node *item = first;
      while (item != NULL) {
        printf("item is at %p; next is at %p; data is %d\n",
    	   (void *)item, (void *)item->next, item->data);
        item = item->next;
      }
    }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : item is at 0x5f60acda72c0; next is at 0x5f60acda72a0; data is 20
  : item is at 0x5f60acda72a0; next is at (nil); data is 10

- Making the cast explicit in =printf= ensures portability (treat
  pointer as generic) & avoids implicit conversion warnings.

* Practice: Create an insertion function =add_to_list=

- Write a function =add_to_list= that inserts a node into a linked list.

  #+begin_src C :main no
    struct node {
      int data;
      struct node *next;
    };

    // task: print list
    // return: nothing
    // params: pointer to list node structure
    void print_list(struct node *list);

    // task: add to list from beginning
    // return: pointer to new node (now beginning of list)
    // params: pointer to list, data to store
    struct node *add_to_list(struct node *list, int n);

    int main(void)
    {

      // declare two pointers
      struct node *first = NULL;

      for (int i=1; i<4; i++)
        first = add_to_list(first,i*10);
      print_list(first);
      return 0;
    }

    void print_list(struct node *first)
    {
      struct node *item = first;
      while (item != NULL) {
        printf("item is at %p; next is at %p; data is %d\n",
    	   (void *)item, (void *)item->next, item->data);
        item = item->next;
      }
    }

    struct node *add_to_list(struct node *first, int n)
    {
      struct node *new_node; // declare new node
      new_node = malloc(sizeof(struct node)); // allocate new member
      new_node->data = n; // store data member
      new_node->next = first; // repoint next member to previous member
      first = new_node; // repoint beginning of list to new member
      return new_node;
    }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : item is at 0x64bce66612e0; next is at 0x64bce66612c0; data is 30
  : item is at 0x64bce66612c0; next is at 0x64bce66612a0; data is 20
  : item is at 0x64bce66612a0; next is at (nil); data is 10

- When the new node is a =NULL= pointer, no memory should be added, and
  it is better to add this check after the allocation of =new_node=:

  #+begin_example C
    if (new_node == NULL) {
      printf("Error: malloc failed in add_to_list\n");
      exit (EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
  #+end_example
