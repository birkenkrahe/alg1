* Objectives

This course on "Data Structures with C++" offers an in-depth
exploration into the theory and application of data structures using
the C++ programming language. It aims to equip students with the
knowledge to efficiently store, process, and retrieve data using
various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues,
trees, and graphs. The curriculum emphasizes the importance of
algorithmic thinking and optimization techniques, providing a solid
foundation for understanding the complexities and capabilities of
modern computing systems.

* Target audience

 Ideal participants are those who have a basic understanding of
 programming concepts and are interested in advancing their knowledge
 in data structuring to improve software efficiency and performance.

* Student Learning Outcomes

Students who complete this course will be able to:
- Demonstrate a thorough understanding of major data structures and
  their applications.
- Implement various data structures in C++, including arrays, linked
  lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
- Analyze the efficiency of data structures and algorithms in terms of
  time and space complexity.
- Apply algorithmic thinking to solve complex problems using
  appropriate data structures.
- Design and develop efficient software solutions for real-world
  applications.
- Critically evaluate the choice of data structures in software
  development projects.
- Employ advanced C++ features and object-oriented programming
  techniques in the context of data structures.
- Enhance problem-solving skills through the design and analysis of
  algorithms for data manipulation.
- Prepare to contribute effectively to technology-driven environments
  with a strong foundation in data structuring.

Students, who complete CSC 240 will have fulfilled the prerequisites
for CSC 265 Algorithms.

* Course requirements

Formal prerequisites: Introduction to Programming (either CSC100 or
CSC115 or CSC109, and MTH101 (College Algebra).

Course requirements include a foundational knowledge of programming
principles and familiarity with any programming language. Students
are expected to have completed introductory courses in computer
science or possess equivalent practical experience. A willingness to
engage in complex problem-solving and the ability to think critically
about algorithm design and data manipulation are essential for success
in this course.

* Grading

| WHEN    | DESCRIPTION             | IMPACT |
|---------+-------------------------+--------|
| Weekly  | Programming assignments |    25% |
| Monthly | Sprint reviews          |    25% |
| Weekly  | Tests                   |    25% |
| TBD     | Final exam (optional)   |    25% |

- Sprint reviews are monthly project progress reports
- Tests are open-book multiple choice exams for home
- The final exam is optional if you want to improve your grade

* Learning management system

- We use Lyon's Canvas installation for this course.
- The home page contains: assignments, grades, pages, people,
  syllabus, quizzes, Google Drive, Course evaluation and Zoom.
- The Zoom page includes cloud recordings of all past sessions.
- Recorded sessions will be deleted after the last class.

* GitHub

All course materials are available in a public GitHub repository
([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/csc240][github.com/birkenkrahe/csc240]]). Registration for students
includes a free subscription to GitHub codespaces with the AI coding
assistant Copilot. GitHub is the worldwide largest online platform for
software development.

* Dates and class schedule

"Data structures" and "algorithms" are a little hard to separate:
- "Data structures" is concerned with storing and organizing data.
- "Algorithms" is concerned with using data to solve problems.

Both topics can be taught language-agnostic (without referencing a
particular language) but your understanding will benefit greatly from
examples and programming assignments.
