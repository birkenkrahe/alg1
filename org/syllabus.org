* Materials and multimedia

- 100-page C++ language reference (written by a group of student
  volunteers over a weekend!): "Rook's Guide to C++" (Hansen, 2013) -
  [[https://rooksguide.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rooks-guide-isbn-version.pdf][Online]]. The equivalent material in a complete textbook
  (e.g. Malik, 2015) covers no less than 1,000 pages.
  
- Textbook (optional): Helfrich, C++ Data Structures (KendallHunt,
  2020). Recommended: Kanetkar Y, Data Structures Through C++ 5th ed
  (bpb,2024). Malik, C++ Programming - Program Design Including Data
  Structures (Cengage 2015); La Rocca, Grokking Data Structures
  (Manning 2023) - with Python; Morin, Open Data Structures (in C++)
  (OpenText, 2013).

- Videos: The [[https://scottbarrett.com/][Udemy course]] "C++ Data Structures & Algorithms +
  LEETCODE Exercises" is very good (nice animations). I've used this
  as well as [[https://www.youtube.com/@CPlusPlusDataStructures/videos][Helfrich's YouTube videos]] (for his book). Animations can
  be helpful for this topic to visualize multi-dimensional, dynamic
  processes. The [[https://youtu.be/B31LgI4Y4DQ?si=mu7z5qTupDg1Pu3x][freeCodeCamp course]] is more teacher-centric but OK.

- There is a gazillion sources available online and offline on the
  topics of data structures and algorithms. Many of the books are
  great for the first 10, good for the next 30, and disappointing for
  the lats 300 pages. Many of the videos are great for the first 5 and
  lousy for the last 15-30 minutes.

- I have looked at dozens of books, videos, courses, and
  tutorials. Ask me if you found a specific source - I may know it, or
  I may want to learn more about it!

* Objectives

This course on "Data Structures with C++" offers an in-depth
exploration into the theory and application of data structures using
the C++ programming language. It aims to equip students with the
knowledge to efficiently store, process, and retrieve data using
various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues,
trees, and graphs. The curriculum emphasizes the importance of
algorithmic thinking and optimization techniques, providing a solid
foundation for understanding the complexities and capabilities of
modern computing systems.

* Target audience

 Ideal participants are those who have a basic understanding of
 programming concepts and are interested in advancing their knowledge
 in data structuring to improve software efficiency and performance.

* Student Learning Outcomes

Students who complete this course will be able to:
- Demonstrate a thorough understanding of major data structures and
  their applications.
- Implement various data structures in C++, including arrays, linked
  lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
- Analyze the efficiency of data structures and algorithms in terms of
  time and space complexity.
- Apply algorithmic thinking to solve complex problems using
  appropriate data structures.
- Design and develop efficient software solutions for real-world
  applications.
- Critically evaluate the choice of data structures in software
  development projects.
- Employ advanced C++ features and object-oriented programming
  techniques in the context of data structures.
- Enhance problem-solving skills through the design and analysis of
  algorithms for data manipulation.
- Prepare to contribute effectively to technology-driven environments
  with a strong foundation in data structuring.

Students, who complete CSC 240 will have fulfilled the prerequisites
for CSC 265 Algorithms.

* Course requirements

Formal prerequisites: Introduction to Programming (either CSC100 or
CSC115 or CSC109, and MTH101 (College Algebra).

Course requirements include a foundational knowledge of programming
principles and familiarity with any programming language. Students
are expected to have completed introductory courses in computer
science or possess equivalent practical experience. A willingness to
engage in complex problem-solving and the ability to think critically
about algorithm design and data manipulation are essential for success
in this course.

"Data structures" and "algorithms" are a little hard to separate:
- "Data structures" is concerned with storing and organizing data.
- "Algorithms" is concerned with using data to solve problems.

Both topics can be taught language-agnostic (without referencing a
particular language) but your understanding will benefit greatly from
examples and programming assignments.
