* Week 1

This week we met for our first session to get (re)acquainted with one
another, begin to learn about data structures, and understand what the
course is about.

** Why is the maximum number for a =char= type =127= and what does that mean?

It means that the computer can represent 127 characters, including
lower- and upper-case alphanumeric characters like ='a'= and ='A'=,
symbols like =+=, punctuation like =!=, and special characters like
newline, carriage return etc.

The maximum value is a constant stored in =limits.h=:
#+begin_src C :includes <float.h> <limits.h> <stdio.h>
  printf("%d\n", SCHAR_MAX);
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 127

=127= is the maximum because the ASCII standard historically uses 7
bits - with 7 bits, each bit has two values so you can represent
2^7=128 different values, from 0 to 127.

To print the ASCII value of a character, print it with the =%d= format
specifier reserved for =int= (integer) values:
#+begin_src C :main yes :includes <stdio.h>
  printf("%d %d %d\n",'a','A','\\'); // the `\` must be escaped to be
  // printed as a character
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 97 65 64

Later, an 8-th bit was added to extend the character set to 2^8 = 256
so that special symbols (like German umlauts =ü=, or the German =ß=) could
be represented.

** Syllabus: About Using AI to write code for you or debug your code

I'm feeling quite strongly about this - [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/fall24/UsingAItoCode.org][here are my views]], which I
also attached to the syllabus.

** Review questions

1. Do you remember any differences between C, C++, and C#?
   #+begin_quote
   For example:
   - C allows you to manage your computer's memory directly, and was
     developed in the 1970s.
   - C++ is an Object-Oriented extension of C,and was developed in
     the 1980.
   - C# was developed by Microsoft for commercial applications, and
     was developed in the early 2000s.

2. What is a reason to use C in a course on data structures?
   #+begin_quote
   C is small and basic, and does not have many layers of abstractions
   (aka complex concepts) so that you can see and use data structures
   more directly.
   #+end_quote

3. What is the computing infrastructure that we use in this course?
   #+begin_quote
   1. GitHub
   2. Linux
   3. Emacs
   #+end_quote

4. What does it mean that the maximum value for a =char= data type is =127=?
   #+begin_quote
   It means that the computer can represent 127 characters, including
   lower- and upper-case alphanumeric characters like ='a'= and ='A'=,
   symbols like =+=, punctuation like =!=, and special characters like
   newline, carriage return etc.

   =127= is the maximum because the ASCII standard historically uses 7
   bits - with 7 bits, each bit has two values so you can represent
   =2^7=128= different values, from 0 to 127.
   #+end_quote

5. What are C's primitive (or built-in) data types?
   #+begin_quote
   - Integer (=int=)
   - Floating-point (=float= or =double=)
   - Character (=char=)
   - Void (=void=)
   #+end_quote

Tell me a joke

[AI]: Sure! Here’s a light-hearted one for you:

Why did the scarecrow win an award?

Because he was outstanding in his field!

[ME]: which GPT are you?

[AI]: I’m based on OpenAI's GPT-3 model. How can I assist you today?

[ME]: Is Emacs the best editor?

[AI]: The question of whether Emacs is the "best" editor is subjective and depends on personal preferences and specific use cases. Here are some points to consider:

### Advantages of Emacs:
- **Extensibility**: Emacs is highly customizable and can be extended with Emacs Lisp, allowing users to tailor the editor to their needs.
- **Integration**: It contains a wide range of built-in features, such as a calendar, email client, and even a web browser.
- **Keyboard-centric**: Emacs is designed for efficient keyboard use, giving users powerful shortcuts for navigation and editing.
- **Community and Packages**: There is a large ecosystem of packages (like Magit for Git integration) and a supportive community.

### Disadvantages of Emacs:
- **Steep Learning Curve**: New users may find it overwhelming due to its extensive features and unique keybindings.
- **Performance**: For very large files, Emacs may not perform as efficiently as other editors.
- **Complexity**: The vast array of configuration options can be daunting.

### Alternative Editors:
- **Vim**: Known for its modal editing and efficiency. Some users prefer Vim’s approach to text manipulation.
- **VS Code**: A modern text editor with a user-friendly interface, extensive extensions, and support for multiple programming languages.
- **Sublime Text**: Valued for its speed and simplicity, with strong support for plugins.

Ultimately, the best editor is the one that fits your workflow and enhances your productivity. It can be worth trying out a few to see which one you prefer!
