1. Go to [[https://cloud.google.com/shell/][cloud.google.com/shell/]] and register with your Lyon Google
   account. This is completely free for up to 50 hours per week.

2. In a Google Chrome browser, install the shell as an app on your PC:
   open browser settings, then =Save and share > Install shell=.

3. Open a terminal (aka command-line, aka shell, aka Console). Emacs
   and GCC are already installed. Click on the ">_" symbol:
   #+attr_html: :width 600px:
   [[../img/shell.png]]

4. Get the =.emacs= configuration file with the following command:
   #+begin_example bash
   wget -O .emacs http://tinyurl.com/lyon-emacs
   #+end_example

5. To check, start a terminal (non-GUI) Emacs with the command:
   #+begin_example bash
   emacs -nw
   #+end_example

6. The configuration file should now be read and used. You can push
   Emacs in the background to return to the command-line with =C-z=. Do
   this now, then return to Emacs by typing =fg= on the command-line.

7. Back in Emacs, create an Org-mode file =test.org=: type the command
   =C-x C-f test.org RET=

8. An empty buffer named =test.org= opens. Enter the following at the
   top of the file - achieve indentation with =<TAB>=.
   #+begin_example org
   * Testing C

     Print the size of an integer number in bytes:

     #+begin_src C
       #include <stdio.h>

       int main(void)
       {
         printf("Size of integer: %zu byte.\n", sizeof(int));
         return 0;
       }
     #+end_src
   #+end_example

9. Save the file with =C-x C-s=. Run the program by putting the cursor
   anywhere on or between =#+begin_src= and =#+end_src= and typing =C-c
   C-c=.

10. Now remove everything in the code except the =printf= function call,
    and add =:main yes :includes <stdio.h>= to the code block header.

11. Run the code again with =C-c C-c=. The result should be the same.

12. Lastly, add =:tangle size.c= to the code block header:

    #+begin_example org
    * Testing C

     Print the size of an integer number in bytes:

     #+begin_src C :main yes :includes <stdio.h> :tangle sizeof.c
         printf("Size of integer: %zu byte.\n", sizeof(int));
     #+end_src
   #+end_example

13. Tangle the source code to file with the command =M-x
    org-babel-tangle=. You should get the message =Tangled 1 code block
    from test.org=. Save the file with =C-x C-s= then quit Emacs
    altogether with =C-x C-c=.

14. On the command-line, type =ls= to list all files, and you should now
    see =sizeof.c=. Compile it as an executable called =size=, and run it:
    #+begin_src bash
      gcc sizeof.c -o size
      ./size
    #+end_src

15. To shut the application down, enter =exit= at the command-line. If
    you still have a job running (like an open Emacs), type it twice.

* Summary

1. Literate programming combines documentation, source code, and
   output in one file. You can tangle the source code and weave the
   documentation.

2. The =wget= program allows you to download files using the Web URL.

3. You can use the Emacs editor in GUI or in terminal (=-nw= or "no
   windows") mode. In Google Cloud Shell, only the terminal Emacs will
   work.

4. An Org-mode file is a literate program. Inside Org-mode, code
   blocks begin with =#+begin_src= and end with =#+end_src=. To run, a
   code block has to have a language (e.g. C), and the Emacs
   configuration file (=~/.emacs=) has to have been loaded.

5. In Org-mode files, you can run code with =C-c C-c=. For C programs,
   the header of a code block substitutes =#include= directives and the
   =main= function.
