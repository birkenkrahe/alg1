* Motivation

- There are three user-defined data structures that help organize data
  and group them logically:

  | Data Structure | Explanation                                                   |
  |----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------|
  | =struct=         | Different types. Each member has its own memory location.     |
  | =enum=           | Assigns names to integer constants. All members are integers. |
  | =union=          | Groups variables, members share the same memory location.     |

  | Data Structure | Use Cases                                                     |
  |----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------|
  | =struct=         | Complex objects like points, employees, or students.          |
  | =enum=           | Fixed sets of values (days of the week, states, error codes). |
  | =union=          | Optimizing memory usage.                                      |

- Structures are by far the most important so we'll spend most of our
  time on them.

* First examples

- Structure example: A point is defined as a pair of (x,y)
  values. Once the =struct= is defined, =Point= can be used like any other
  data type.
  #+begin_src C
    // Declare Point structure

    // Main program
  #+end_src

- Enumeration example: The =enum= =Day= is an integer type whose values
  are named.
  #+begin_src C
    enum Day { MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, SAT, SUN };

    int main() {
      enum Day today = WED;
      printf("Today is day number: %d\n", today); // Output: 2 (WED)
      return 0;
    }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Today is day number: 2

- Union example: Similar to a structure except that its members share
  the same storage so that only one member can be stored at a time.
  #+begin_src C
    // declare data Union

    // Main program
    int main() {
      // Define data as Data

      // Assign data values

      // Print data values
      n
      return 0;
    }
  #+end_src

* Structure variables

- So far, we've only covered one data structure, the array. Array
  elements all must have the same type and they can be subscripted.

- Structure members can have different types, and they have names,
  which we use rather than their position.

- Most high level languages provide this feature:
  1. In C++, the =class= is an extension of the =struct= with the
     difference that its members are =private= by default.
  2. In R, the =list= is a =struct= without methods (with with =apply=), and
     custom methods can be defined.
  3. In SQL, the =table= schema is a =struct= (without methods). Foreign
     keys link tables like pointers in C.

* Declaring structure variables

- Structures are for storing a collection of related data items - for
  example parts in a warehouse, represented by:
  1) Part =number= (integer)
  2) Part =name= (string)
  3) Number of parts =on_hand= (integer)

- In code:
  #+name: parts
  #+begin_src C :results none

  #+end_src

- Members are stored in memory in the order in which they are
  declared: [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/alg1/blob/main/img/struct.png][See image]]

- Here, =number= and =on_hand= occupy 4 bytes (=int=), and =name= occupies 25
  bytes (=char= has 1 byte x 25).

- Usually, structures are represented by adjacent vertical or
  horizontal boxes:  [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/alg1/blob/main/img/struct2.png][See image]]

- Structure scope: Each structure represents a new block scope, and
  its names will not conflict with other names in a program. This is
  also called a =namespace=.

- You remember this concept from beginner's C++: By declaring the
  namespace =std= at the start, you don't have to write =std::cout= and
  =std::endl=.
  #+begin_src C++ :includes <iostream>

  #+end_src

* Using a structure

- Now let's use this parts structure:
  #+begin_src C
    <<parts>>
    
    // main program
    int main(void)
    {
      // use parts structure

      // print part1 data

      return 0;
    }
  #+end_src

* Practice: Create and test an employee database structure

- Replicate this code for another structure that contains the
  following information on employees: =number=, =name=, and =sex=. Define
  two employees, =employee1= and =employee2=.

  When the code compiles, test the structure in a =main= program for
  =employee1= whose name is "Fritz Fisch", who is male and has the
  employee number 205482.

- Generate the output:
  #+begin_example
    Employee: Fritz Fisch, number = 285942, sex = M
  #+end_example

- Solution:
  #+begin_src C
    // declare structure

    // main program
    int main(void)
    {
      // define employee1

      // print employee1 details

      return 0;
    }
  #+end_src

* Initializing structure variables

- A structure declaration may include an initializer.

- Non-initialized members are set to 0.

- Initializers can be /positional/ (same order as in declaration), or
  /designated/ (any order as long as they're named): In the code below,
  =part1= is initialized with a designator, while =part2= is not.

  #+begin_src C
    #define NAME_LEN 25
    struct {
      int number;
      char name[NAME_LEN+1];
      int on_hand;
    } ...

    printf("Part 1: %s, number = %d, on hand = %d\n"
           "Part 2: %s, number = %d, on hand = %d\n",
           part1.name, part1.number, part1.on_hand,
           part2.name, part2.number, part2.on_hand);
  #+end_src

* Operations on structures

- The members of a structure are /lvalues/: they can appear left of an
  assignment, or as the operand in an increment/decremend expression:

- Like an array, a structure variable can be initialized and declared
  at once:

  #+begin_src C
    <<parts>> // declaration of parts only

  #+end_src

- The period to access a structure is a C operator. It takes
  precedence over nearly all other operators. Other C-like languages
  with user-defined structures or classes have this dot-operator, too.

  Python example:
  #+begin_src python :python python3 :results output
    import numpy as np
    arr = np.array([1,2,3]) # use array method of numpy library
    print(arr)
  #+end_src

- In the following statement, the argument contains two operators: the
  "dot" operator takes precedence: =&= computes the address of =part.num=:
#+begin_example C
  scanf("%d", &part.num);
#+end_example

- Though arrays cannot be copied using ===, structures can!

  #+begin_src C
    <<parts>>

    // initialize part1

    printf("Part 1: %s, number = %d, on hand = %d\n"
           "Part 2: %s, number = %d, on hand = %d\n",
           part1.name, part1.number, part1.on_hand,
           part2.name, part2.number, part2.on_hand);

    // copy one structure into another


    printf("Part 1: %s, number = %d, on hand = %d\n"
           "Part 2: %s, number = %d, on hand = %d\n",
           part1.name, part1.number, part1.on_hand,
           part2.name, part2.number, part2.on_hand);
  #+end_src

- You can use this to copy arrays with dummy structures:
  #+begin_src C

  #+end_src

- No other operations but === are available. In particular, there is no
  way to compare structures with logical operators (==== and =!==).

- The === operator only works if the structures types /compatible/, which
  means that they must be declared at the same time.

* Structure types

- We need to define a name that represents the /type/ of structure, not
  a particular (anonymous) structure /variable/.

- We can either define a /structure tag/ or use /typedef/ to define a type
  name for our structure:

- This example declares a structure tag named =Part=:
  #+name: Part
  #+begin_src C :main no :results none

  #+end_src

- The tag can now be used to declare variables:

  #+begin_src C :results none
    <<Part>>

    struct Part part1, part2; // must be prefixed by `struct`

  #+end_src

- Declaration of a tag and of structure variables can be combined:

  #+begin_src C

  #+end_src

- Alternatively, use =typedef= to define a genuine data type. All =Part=
  variables, no matter when they're declared, are compatible.

- Declaring a structure tag is mandatory when the structure is used in
  a linked list.

* Practice: Creating a structure tag

1. Define a structure =Book= that has the following members:
   - An integer =id=.
   - A string =title= (with a maximum length of 50).
   - A float =price=.

2. Declare and initialize two =Book= variables:
   - =book1= with the =id= 101, =title= "C Programming", and =price= 29.99.
   - =book2= without initialization.

Bonus assignment (see next section):

1. Write a program to:
   - Print the details of =book1=.
   - Assign values to the members of =book2= (=id= 102, =title= "Data
     Structures", =price= 39.99).
   - Print the details of =book2=.

4. Use functions to:
   - Print the details of a =Book= structure.
   - Update the =price= of a book based on a percentage discount. 

* Structures as arguments and return values

- Functions may have structures as arguments and return values.

- Example: This function, when given a =Part= structure as its argument,
  prints the structure's members:

  #+begin_src C :tangle parts.c
    // Define a structure with a tag
    struct Part {
      int number; 
      char name[50];
      int on_hand; 
    };

    // Function to print a part

    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
        // Initialize part1


        // Print part1 details

        return 0;
    }
  #+end_src

- The second function returns a =Part= structure that it constructs from
  its arguments:

  #+begin_src C
    // Define a structure with a tag
    struct Part {
      int number; 
      char name[50];
      int on_hand; 
    };

    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
      // Create a Part using the build_part function

      
      // Print part details
      
      return 0;
    }
  #+end_src
